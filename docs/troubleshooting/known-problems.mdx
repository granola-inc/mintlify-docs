As a rule, keep your MacOS and your Granola up to date, we're finding and fixing bugs all the time so there's a chance that by the time you've noticed it, we've deployed a fix in the latest version!

### Problem: Transcription won't start

If Granola quickly switches from "dancing bars" to a spinning wheel, it usually means that Granola can't connect to its transcription service.

Common causes and potential fixes:

- For some users, Granola cannot resolve the domain name for our transcription API.
  Try [using `8.8.8.8` as your DNS server.](https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/using#macos)

### Problem: Notes won't enhance

Common causes and potential fixes:

- For some users, Granola cannot resolve the domain name for our "enhance notes" API.
  Try [using `8.8.8.8` as your DNS server.](https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/using#macos)

### Problem: Granola slows down my computer

### Problem: I can't see my calendar events

### Problem: When I have Granola open, it slows typing into other applications

If you're on macOS 15.1, try updating to 15.2.

### Problem: When I have Granola open, Zoom or other meeting platforms lag
