Currently, Granola supports **English** only. We know many customers want transcripts in their native language, so we’re exploring:

- Spanish
- French
- German
- Additional languages

If you’d like to request a specific language, join our [waitlist](https://tally.so/r/mDAZlZ). Or contact us at [hey@granola.so](mailto:help@granola.so) to share your feedback.

### Why don't we support more languages yet?

We've made the decision to include live transcription in Granola. Many of our users have meetings in multiple languages, and transcribing in real-time as people switch between languages is a complex technical challenge. Our transcription service provider is working on it, but we can't be specific about timelines.
