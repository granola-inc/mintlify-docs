### Guide to Perfect Bug Reporting for Granola

To ensure our development team can address any technical issues effectively, it’s vital to provide detailed and clear bug reports. Follow these guidelines to create a perfect bug report:

1. Clear Description of the Issue:

2. Steps to Reproduce:

Provide a step-by-step account of how you encountered the issue. This should be detailed enough that someone else could follow and experience the bug themselves.

3. Expected vs. Actual Results:

Clearly outline what you expected to happen versus what actually occurred. This helps the team understand the discrepancy and identify potential causes.

Specify the hardware (such as MacBook or Dell laptops) and the operating system you are using. Include version numbers wherever possible as some bugs may be specific to certain setups .

Mention if there were any recent changes such as software updates or configuration changes prior to the issue beginning. This information can help trace the origin.

Indicate how severe the issue is (e.g., minor annoyance vs. critical blocker) and how often it occurs. This helps prioritize fixes[2].

8. Log Files or Error Messages:

If applicable, attach logs or specific error messages that appear when the bug is triggered. These provide critical insights for developers.

Detail any running background processes, VPN use, or third-party applications that might interact with Granola .
