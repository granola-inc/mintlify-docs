# Reporting Bugs

We want to squash bugs fast. Here’s how to help:

1. **Use in-app “Report a Bug”**:  
   - Open Granola → **Settings** → **Feedback**. Summarize the issue.  

2. **Email**:  
   - Send to [hey@granola.so](mailto:hey@granola.so).  
   - Include steps to reproduce, screenshots and your OS version if possible.

## Best Practices for Bugs

- **Clear description**: Summarize what happened vs. what you expected.  
- **Steps to reproduce**: Provide a step-by-step so we can replicate.  
- **Attach screenshots or videos**: A picture is worth a thousand words.  
- **Severity**: Note if this is blocking you or just a minor annoyance by using the toggle.  

Thanks for helping us improve Granola! Someone from our team will get back to you as soon as possible.
