We take your data seriously. Below are common questions regarding how Granola keeps your information safe.

### Do you store audio or video?

No. Granola only stores text transcripts and notes. Audio is processed in real time, but never stored.

### Are my notes private?

Yes. By default, your notes are private to you. Sharing links are off unless you enable them. Granola never auto-sends meeting summaries to other participants.

### Where is data hosted?

We host data in the United States, on secure cloud infrastructure. We do not currently offer on-prem hosting.

### Is data encrypted?

Yes. Granola uses industry-standard encryption to protect your data.

### Can I delete my account & data?

Yes. In **Settings**, there is an option to delete your account, which removes your data from our systems.

### Are you compliant with major data privacy laws?

We comply with relevant data protection laws to the extent applicable, including GDPR for EU users. See our [Privacy Policy](https://go.granola.so/privacy) for more details.

### Are calls automatically transcribed?

They aren't. For each meeting, you can choose whether or not to transcribe.
