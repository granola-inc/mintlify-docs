Granola transcribes your computer audio in realtime. It does not store recorded audio or video. Instead, it saves the transcript and uses it to enhance your notes. For more information about how Granola collects, uses, and stores transcripts and other data, please see Granola’s Privacy Policy, located at [www.granola.so/pp](https://www.granola.so/pp).

Depending on where your meeting participants are located, you may need to get consent from participants in meetings prior to using Granola to transcribe. You can find more information on recording laws state by state [here](https://url.us.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/9qhYCpYmqOfOpRJnfDYFqL?domain=justia.com/). Please note, this is a third-party resource and Granola is not responsible for the accuracy of third-party websites.

Ultimately, you are responsible for obtaining consent from participants where required by law. Regardless of whether you are legally required to do so, we strongly recommend that you always ask for consent before transcribing.
