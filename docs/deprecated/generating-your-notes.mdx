After a meeting ends, Granola takes your transcript, meeting context and typed notes to create one polished summary.

### Black and grey notes

- When Granola [detects the call is over](docs/101/duringyourmeeting/live-transcription#when-does-transcription-end) or you manually end the transcription, it merges your typed notes (in **black text**) with context from the transcript (in **gray text**).

### Your notes vs Granola's notes

- **Raw notes**: Anything you jotted down during the meeting. 
- **Enhanced notes**: The Granola-generated summary of the meeting.  

You can switch between these views at the bottom of the Granola notes editor window.

### Edit or re-enhance your generatednotes

- Click on any text to edit it. Granola changes it from gray to black to show you authored it.  
- If you want the AI to incorporate new changes, go back to **Raw Notes**, tweak them, and press **Enhance** again.
