Once your meeting is finished, you can apply a template to your notes. This is especially useful if you have lots of recurring meetings and you want to keep your notes consistent.

Each template is organised into sections:

* "Meeting Context" lets you provide a broad overview of the purpose of the meeting and what's important to you. It might contain stylistic details or instructions too.&#x20;

* "Sections" are the headings you want to see in your enhanced notes with description about what you'd want to see in those sections.&#x20;

Granola will take the selected template as its structure and populate it with details from your transcript and notes.&#x20;
