### &#xA;&#xA;Multi-language Support

Multi-language support is a highly requested feature and we're actively exploring ways to incorporate this in 2025, but we are dependent on when our transcription provider releases new languages and can't control this ourselves.&#x20;


### Automatic Start for All Meetings

The ability to opt into automatically starting Granola for all meetings is under consideration. We're mindful of the complexities this might cause when people accidentally transcribe meetings they wouldn't want to access, and so we want to build better functionality around deleting or editing transcripts first.&#x20;


### Automatic Export to Notion

This is our most requests integration and as Notion users ourselves, we hear you! Right now we're focusing on organizing notes on-platform better, but more integrations is something we're evaluating for 2025.&#x20;

### Mobile or Tablet Version of Granola

It's coming! Join the waitlist here.&#x20;

### **Add Templates Before The Meeting**

We've experimented with this as a feature and we haven't found a way for it to not interrupt the flow of your own notes during the call. We're still looking into whether we can make this work, as we understand having prompts for interviews or regular calls would be helpful!

### In-App Sharing and Shared With Me Tab

Better team functionality including sharing notes with your team is a priority for us in early 2025! Keep an eye out for updates on this front.&#x20;

Standard Response: A chat interface for AI-driven interaction, with summary and context refinement, is an intriguing idea. We're evaluating its feasibility based on user needs\[10].
