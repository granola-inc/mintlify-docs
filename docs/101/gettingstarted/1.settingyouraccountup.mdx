### Account setup FAQs


<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I sign up with my personal Gmail account?">
    Granola is designed for a professional company environment, so for now, we're focusing on developing it for teams.

    If you prefer to sign up with a personal account, you'll be added to a waitlist for approval. We periodically invite groups from the waitlist to join, but it might take anywhere from a few minutes to a few weeks
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I sign up with Outlook or another email platform?">
    We’re trying to make the experience as good as possible for Google users for now, but expanding the platform to serve other platforms is in the roadmap. Join [the waitlist](https://google.com).

    In the meantime, [this workaround](/docs/integrations/using-granola-with-outlook.mdmx) works for some people who have Outlook accounts. It depends how strict your IT department is though.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use Granola on Windows?">
    Not just yet, but you can join [our waitlist](https://go.granola.so/windows) and do keep an eye on our Twitter page for announcements around our latest product releases.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does Granola work with calendars other than Google Calendar?">
    Granola is designed to work best with Google Calendar. For Outlook users, we have a workaround available, but it may not be as seamless depending on your organisation's IT policies.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use Granola with multiple Google accounts?">
    Yes! While we don't support multiple logins directly, you can still access all your calendars through your primary Granola account by sharing them between your Google accounts. You can find instructions on how to share your calendar here: https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/37082?hl=en

    Once that's set up, just hover over "Coming Up" in Granola, click the Settings cog, and you'll be able to toggle your additional calendars on and off from there.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is there a mobile app for Granola?">
    A mobile app is on our roadmap, but we don't have a specific release date yet. We'll announce it through our Slack channels and email updates when it's available.
