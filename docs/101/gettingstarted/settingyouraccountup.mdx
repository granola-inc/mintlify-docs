### Email & login options

Granola is designed for professional teams and works best with company email accounts. When signing up, you'll use your Google Workspace account for seamless calendar integration and meeting management.

<Info>
  If you try to sign up with your personal Google account, you will be added to our waitlist and given access to the platform anywhere between two minutes and four weeks.&#x20;

## Using Granola Without Google Workspace?

Currently, Granola works best with **Google Workspace** for seamless integration. If you only have a personal Gmail address, there is a **Gmail Beta** program. You can join this waitlist or contact us to see if we can enable personal Gmail access.

## Office 365 or Outlook Users
- **Native Outlook Support** is not yet available. If you want to test Granola with an Office 365 account, you can:
  1. **Publish** your Outlook calendar to an ICS link.
  2. **Import** that ICS link into Google Calendar.
  3. **Toggle it on** in Granola to see your events (see [Using Granola with Outlook](/docs/integrations/using-granola-with-outlook)).

If you do not wish to create a Google Workspace account at all, note that you can still download Granola and log in with **personal Gmail** (when granted Beta access). You’d then sync your Outlook events into that personal Gmail. This is an extra step, but it’s currently the only workaround.
