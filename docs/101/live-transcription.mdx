### When does transcription begin

Granola begins transcribing only when you have opened a set of meeting notes&#x20;



### **Viewing the Transcript**

Open your live transcript at any time during the meeting by clicking the "dancing bars" icon. This lets you:

* See what's being captured in real-time

* Verify audio is working correctly

* Review recent discussion points

### **How can I query a live meeting?**

Use cmnd+S to open the Ask Granola sidebar and ask questions of the transcript up til the point you're asking. It can help you catch up on missed details or inform a question you need to ask. Sample questions might be:

* In bullet points, what did I just miss?

* What did David say about SOC2 compliance at the start of the meeting?&#x20;

* Can you list all the actions I've agreed to take in this meeting so far?&#x20;


### **Audio Status**

The audio indicator shows when Granola is actively transcribing. Look for:

* Green indicator for active transcription

* Microphone status

* System audio status

* Audio device selection



**FAQs**

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why doesn't the transcript show exactly who is speaking?" defaultOpen={false}>
    Our system uses system audio and microphone audio to distinguish between speakers ("me" vs "them") without needing a meeting bot in your calls. As a result, your transcripts will only distinguish between audio that comes from your mic vs your system audio and real-time speaker identification remains technically challenging.

    We offer two tools to help you work with transcripts:

    * A zoom in function in your enhanced notes for detailed transcript review

    * An Ask Granola chat for transcript analysis and information retrieval&#x20;


    While speaker identification works better in post-processing, live identification is more complex. Though this technology is advancing quickly, implementation depends on industry-wide progress. For now, we're focusing on providing reliable live transcription and useful analysis tools. We expect both the technology and Granola's transcription to improve rapidly.
