Depending on your location, you may have a legal obligation to inform attendees that youâ€™re recording or transcribing a call.

Granola offers a way to automatically share a message with the participants of your meeting using the inbuilt chat function in Meet and Zoom. 

### Setting Consent Messaging up

If you navigate to the settings tab in Granola, navigate to the Labs tab and find the "Let others know you're using Granola" toggle

When you toggle it on for the first time, a security dialog will pop up with the quite scary request to "control your computer"

The way we've built this feature requires that we can control which window is foregrounded and run some related processes in the background. This is the only part of Granola that requires this permission, we do not use it elsewhere in the app.

Once you've granted this permission, you'll see a text entry box. You can either use our default consent notice, or write your own. 

Now, every time you have a meeting in Google Meet or Zoom, your consent message will automatically send in the chat window of your meeting.

  regulations or company policy. Always check your relevant laws or talk to your 
  legal team to ensure compliance.

### Quick FAQ

- **Are we storing audio?**  
  Granola doesn't store audio, only the transcript.  

- **Is the transcript accessible to others automatically?**  
  No, your notes remain private unless you create or enable sharing links. 
Learn more about transcription in [Live Transcription](/docs/101/duringyourmeeting/live-transcription). Or see [Troubleshooting](/docs/troubleshooting) if you have issues with auto-consent messages or call detection.


## Troubleshooting

### Loom Confetti

If you have Loom running when you're on Granola, it will break this functionality unless you switch off the keyboard shortcut for confetti. 

Open up the Loom widget and click on the three dots to open the settings.
