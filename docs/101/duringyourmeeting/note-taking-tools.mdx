Granola captures the transcript automatically, but your own notes can guide the AI. Here’s how.

### 1. Open the note editor

Once your meeting starts in Granola, you’ll see the **Note Editor** pane. It’s a blank canvas. Use it to type:

- **Key points**: “Project deadlines: next Tuesday”
- **Headers**: Type `# Agenda`, `## Key Moments`, etc.
- **Bullet points**: Use `-` or `*` for bullets.
- **Bold**: `*important*`

### 2. Why add your own notes?

1. **Highlight** big moments or decisions.
2. **Header Tags** help Granola structure the final “enhanced” notes.
3. **Bullets** help Granola capture key important details that matter to you

### 3. Formatting tips

- **Keyboard shortcuts**: <kbd>cmd + B</kbd> for bold, <kbd>cmd + I</kbd> for italics.  
- **Headers**: `#` for top-level, `##` for subheaders, `###` for smaller subsections.
- **Typos and abbreviations**: don't really matter, Granola will understand and fixthem.

<Info>
  You do not have to write any notes for Granola to work. The transcript alone 
  will produce a great summary. But typed notes can significantly improve final results!

### 4. Adding images

If you screenshot something relevant, drag it into the Granola note editor. We won’t embed the image in your final text, but the AI will see it for context. That means your enhanced notes can reflect that screenshot’s content. (We only support JPG or PNG for now.)

Check out [Generating Your Notes](/docs/101/afteryourmeeting/generating-your-notes) to see how your typed notes get blended with the transcript.

### Viewing Previous Notes During a Live Meeting

Currently, Granola supports **one active meeting note window** at a time, which means you can’t open a second window to reference older notes without ending or pausing your current transcription. As a workaround, you can:

- Copy/paste relevant excerpts from old notes into the current note if you need context.
- Use the “Related Meetings” section (scroll down) to see quick references, though opening them fully will pause your current transcription.

We know multiple simultaneous note windows is a popular request and we’re actively exploring it.
