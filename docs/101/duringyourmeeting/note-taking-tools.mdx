### The Granola note editor

Your notes editor enables you to write your own notes that help guide Granola when generating your enhanced meeting notes.&#x20;

* Type your own notes

* Add context to the conversation

* Mark important moments

You can format your notes in real time using Markdown:&#x20;

* Type # for headers

* Use \* for bullet points

* Add **bold** with asterisks


<Info>
  You *do not need to write your own notes.* Even if you don't write any notes at all, Granola will generate a great summary using context from the transcript and your event. You can even apply a template after the notes are generated if you want to have more control over the output.

### Adding headers to create structure

Granola will always take your notes into account when generating your meeting notes, but during your call, you might want to ensure that certain sections are pulled through in your enhanced notes.&#x20;

Any header you add by typing # at the beginning of your sentence will become a section header in your final meeting notes.&#x20;

### Adding images as context

You can easily add images to your notes by capturing screenshots or attachments during your meetings and dragging and dropping the images into your notes editor. For now, you can only see the images in the raw notes version of the app, but the context contained within the images will be added to enhance your Granola notes.&#x20;

There's a limit of ten images per set of notes.&#x20;

<Info>
  For now Granola can only upload JPG and PNG files, we're looking at adding more file types, including PDFs, in the future.
