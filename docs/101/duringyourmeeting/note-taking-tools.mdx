### The Granola note editor

Your notes editor enables you to write your own notes that help guide Granola when generating your enhanced meeting notes.&#x20;

* Type your own notes

* Add context to the conversation

* Mark important moments

You can format your notes in real time using Markdown:&#x20;

* Type # for headers

* Use \* for bullet points

* Add **bold** with asterisks

### Adding headers to create structure

Granola will always take your notes into account when generating your meeting notes, but during your call, you might want to ensure that certain sections are pulled through in your enhanced notes. Any header you add by typing # at the beginning of your sentence will become a section header in your final meeting notes.&#x20;
