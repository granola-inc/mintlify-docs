Sharing your notes and meeting summaries with Granola is straightforward and secure. Hereâ€™s how you can effectively manage sharing features:

### Basic Sharing

Granola allows you to share your meeting notes with colleagues and team members. Sharing is done through custom-generated links that you can easily manage within the app settings.&#x20;

### Generating sharing links

When you sign up to Granola, sharing links will automatically be turned on by default.&#x20;

1. Access your note or summary you wish to share.

2. Click the "Share" button.

3. You'll receive a unique URL that you can distribute to others, granting them view-only access to the content.

4. They'll be able to "Ask Granola" more questions about the meeting

### Turning off sharing links by default

1. Navigate to your settings in Granola.

2. Click "Enable sharing links" on or off, depending on your preferences.

### Turn sharing links on and off per set of notes

In each set of notes, you can turn link sharing on and off. This means that if you've shared a link with someone and you no longer want them to access it, you can disable the link they have.

* If your links are default switched off, you can click "Create link" to generate a new link

* If you want to turn off a link that has been shared publicly, click the drop down arrow beside "Copy link" and select "Disable link"

### Auto-sharing notes

Granola prioritizes your privacy, and does not auto-share your notes to attendees.&#x20;

* Notes and summaries remain private unless you manually create a share link.

* You can control who accesses your content by deciding when and with whom to share your link.
