Granola is more than just a transcription tool‚Äîit‚Äôs an **AI-powered meeting companion** that saves you time, captures crucial details, and organizes all those scattered notes into coherent summaries. Whether you‚Äôre new to Granola or already love it, here are some **advanced tips** to help you get the best from the tool:

---

## 1. Set everything up before you start

### ‚úÖ Make sure Granola has context
- Granola works best when it knows a bit more about you. Ensure your Google Calendar is [properly connected](https://www.granola.ai/docs/docs/101/gettingstarted/calendarintegrations#first-time-setup).  
- Double-check that the events you actually want to transcribe are visible in **Settings ‚Üí Coming Up.**  
- Fill out your profile with key details‚Äîlike your role and areas of focus‚Äîso Granola can provide more relevant insights.

<Info>
  **Remember**: Not every meeting is in your calendar! Use the **New Note** button to manually start transcription for Slack huddles, ad-hoc meetings, and impromptu calls.
</Info> 

###  Check your system audio settings
- Granola uses your Mac's system audio to transcribe meetings, and follows your default settings. 
- Make sure your microphone and speakers are set to the correct input and output.  

<Info>
  **Pro Tip**: Turning your mic input volume all the way up will help Granola transcribe better.
</Info> 

### Manually open the notes to start transcribing
- Start your meeting notes by tapping on the Granola notification or by clicking the New Note button Granola will never [start transcribing](https://www.granola.ai/docs/docs/101/duringyourmeeting/live-transcription#when-does-transcription-begin) automatically.
- If you click out of the set of notes, transcription will stop and you'll have to manually resume it when you reopen the notes.

## 2. During the meeting: stay engaged! (Granola‚Äôs got your back!)  

### Take quick notes for extra precision  
Even if you don‚Äôt type a single note, Granola will generate a summary. But for even better results:  
- **Jot down key points** (decisions, action items, standout quotes).  
- **Use simple bullet points**‚ÄîGranola blends them into your enhanced notes.  
- **Add in your thoughts** that might not make it into the transcript: e.g. reflections on the meeting, your opinions and feedback. 

### Use ‚ÄúAsk Granola‚Äù to catch up instantly  
Got distracted? Need a recap? Granola‚Äôs built-in AI chat [helps you mid-meeting](https://www.granola.ai/docs/docs/101/duringyourmeeting/live-transcription#how-can-i-query-a-live-meeting). Open the sidebar or use the ```CMD+J``` shortcut. Click **‚ÄúWhat did I miss?‚Äù** for a quick summary. Other useful prompts:  
- ‚ÄúSuggest questions for me to ask‚Äù  
- ‚ÄúSummarize the last 5 minutes.‚Äù  
- ‚ÄúList all decisions made so far.‚Äù  

<Info>
  **Heads-up:** Chat history disappears once you close it‚Äîso **copy important insights into your notes!**

## 3. After the meeting: enhance & share  

### Enhance your notes in one click  
Once the meeting ends, Granola automatically enhances your notes by merging your typed notes (black) with the AI summary (gray).  
- **Edit freely**‚Äîanything you change will turn black to show it‚Äôs your input.  
- [**Apply a template**](https://www.granola.ai/docs/docs/101/afteryourmeeting/Usingtemplates) afterward to add structure.  
- **Re-enhance** if you forgot to include something or if you're not happy with the result.

### Share notes instantly  
- Click **Share ‚Üí Create Link** to generate a public URL for your team.  
- **Post directly to Slack** for async updates.  
- **Sync with your CRM** (Affinity, HubSpot, and more coming soon!).  

<Info>
  **Privacy Tip:** You can [disable sharing links anytime](https://www.granola.ai/docs/docs/101/afteryourmeeting/sharing#turning-off-sharing-links-by-default) in **Settings** if needed.

## 4. Hidden gems & pro tips üíé  

### üîç Zoom In for More Context

### Boost Transcription Accuracy  
For **crystal-clear transcripts**, make sure to:
