Granola seamlessly integrates with Google Calendar to display your upcoming meetings. Here's how to set it up:

### Calendar Integration

Currently, Granola only offers full native support for Google Calendar. Granola integrates with your calendar for three critical reasons:

1. Granola sends notifications reminding you to join meetings and take notes

2. It uses context from calendar events to ensure your meeting notes are useful to you

3. You can add notes ahead of or to prepare for a meeting when Granola is integrated with your calendar

<Info>
  &#x20;For Outlook users, we provide a **workaround** that involves linking your Outlook calendar to Google Calendar. The success of this workaround depends on your organization's IT policies – some companies may restrict calendar sharing between platforms.figjam
</Info>

### **First-Time Setup**

* Sign in to Granola using your Google Workspace account.

* When prompted, grant the necessary calendar access permissions.

* Allow a few seconds for your meetings to sync.

* Verify the sync by checking your "Coming Up" section.

<Info>
  Granola requires calendar permissions to do two things

  * Send you notifications when there are upcoming meetings

  * Use context from the calendar to help generate better notes

  It is possible to use Granola without integrating your calendar, but the experience will be more manual and the notes will be less high quality.&#x20;

### **Support for multiple calendars**


Granola only supports multiple calendars through your primary account. To access multiple calendars:

1. [Share additional calendars](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/37082?hl=en) with your primary Google account

2. In Granola, hover over "Coming Up" and click the Settings cog

3. Toggle visibility for your additional calendars

If you're experiencing calendar visibility issues, first check your calendar settings in Granola. Sometimes the app may default to the wrong calendar if you have multiple ones shared with your account.

### **Checking Calendar Connection**

* Click on the settings cog next to "Coming Up".

* Make sure your primary calendar is selected.

* Turn on any additional calendars you wish to view.

* Confirm that your upcoming meetings are displaying correctly.

### **Managing Multiple Calendars**

* Granola doesn't support multiple direct logins, but you can still access multiple calendars:

  1. Share additional calendars with your primary Google account.

  2. Accept these shared calendars in Google Calendar.

  3. In Granola, access the settings cog next to "Coming Up" to toggle visibility for additional calendars.

  4. Changes in calendar visibility take immediate effect.

### **Working with Outlook**

While Granola is optimized for Google Calendar, you can join [this waiting list](https://tally.so/r/wzWb78) to be the first to hear about an Outlook integration - until then, Outlook users can use a workaround:

* **Outlook Integration Steps:**

  1. Link your Outlook calendar to Google Calendar.

  2. Use Granola with your Google account.

  3. Meetings should now appear from both calendars`[3]`.

*Note:* This workaround's success may depend on your organization's IT policies.

### **Common Calendar Issues**

* **No Events Showing:** If no meetings are visible,

  1. Check if the wrong calendar is selected by default.

  2. Verify your primary calendar is selected under "Coming Up".

  3. Toggle other calendars as needed.

* **Calendar Sync Problems:** If you're experiencing sync issues,

  1. Ensure you are using the latest version of Granola.

  2. Double-check calendar permissions in Google.

  3. Consider signing out and back in.

  4. Contact support if problems persist.

* **IT Restrictions:** Check if internal security settings affect your calendar integration by:

  1. Consulting your IT department about third-party calendar access.

  2. Verifying VPN settings that might impact connection.

  3. Requesting necessary permissions if required.

### **Best Practices:**

* **Regular Checks:** Regularly verify if your calendar is syncing correctly.

* **Setup Tips:**

  1. Use your main work calendar as default.

  2. Only turn on the calendars you actively need.

### FAQs

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Is there a way to use my Mac local calendar?" defaultOpen={false}>
    For now, Granola primarily relies on online integrations but recognises that this is a limitation for users with restricted online calendar access due to company policies. We're interested in exploring the use of local calendars, but this feature is not yet part of the current functionality.&#x20;

  <Accordion title="Can I add multiple gmail accounts to one Granola account?" defaultOpen={false}>
    Not yet, but if you share your [gmail calendars](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/37082?hl=en) with each other, you can access all your events from one Granola account. Some organization's IT policies won't allow this, so check with your IT administrator first of all.&#x20;
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I didn't enable Calendar permissions when I signed up, help!" defaultOpen={false}>
    If you quit Granola completely by tapping on the small Granola g in the top bar across your screen, and reopen it, you'll be prompted to give calendar permission again when you log back in.&#x20;
