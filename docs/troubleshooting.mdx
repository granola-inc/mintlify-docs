As a rule, keep your macOS and your Granola up to date,
because we're finding and fixing bugs all the time.

## Problem: Transcription won't start

If Granola quickly switches from "dancing bars" to a spinning wheel,
and no transcript appears in the transcript window,
this usually means that Granola can't connect to our transcription API.

Common causes and potential fixes:

- For some users, Granola cannot resolve the domain name for our transcription API.
  Try [using `8.8.8.8` as your DNS server.](https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/using#macos)
- For some users, Granola cannot establish a [TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) connection to our APIs.
  Things we have seen that work:

  - turn off your VPN
  - remove untrusted certificates from Keychain
  - Whitelist the following domains:
    - `api.granola.ai` and all subdomains, including `stream.api.granola.ai`
    - `*.lambda-url.us-east-1.on.aws`
    - `api.deepgram.com`, our transcription API provider

- For some users, some connections are dropped or time out.
  Try adjusting or removing your firewall.

## Problem: Notes won't enhance

If Granola is stuck on "enhancing notes",
it usually means that Granola can't connect to our "enhance notes" API.

Common causes and potential fixes:

- For some users, Granola cannot resolve the domain name for our transcription API.
  Try [using `8.8.8.8` as your DNS server.](https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/using#macos)
