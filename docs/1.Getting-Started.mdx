### Email & Login Options

Granola is designed for professional teams and works best with company email accounts. When signing up, you'll use your Google Workspace account for seamless calendar integration and meeting management.

<Info>
  If you try to sign up with your personal Google account, you will be added to our waitlist and given access to the platform anywhere between two minutes and four weeks.&#x20;

### Calendar Integration

Currently, Granola only offers full native support for Google Calendar. Granola integrates with your calendar for three critical reasons:

1. Granola sends notifications reminding you to join meetings and take notes

2. It uses context from calendar events to ensure your meeting notes are useful to you

3. You can add notes ahead of or to prepare for a meeting when Granola is integrated with your calendar

<Info>
  &#x20;For Outlook users, we provide a workaround that involves linking your Outlook calendar to Google Calendar. The success of this workaround depends on your organization's IT policies â€“ some companies may restrict calendar sharing between platforms.
</Info>

Granola only supports multiple calendars through your primary account. To access multiple calendars:

1. Share additional calendars with your primary Google account

2. In Granola, hover over "Coming Up" and click the Settings cog

3. Toggle visibility for your additional calendars

If you're experiencing calendar visibility issues, first check your calendar settings in Granola. Sometimes the app may default to the wrong calendar if you have multiple ones shared with your account.
