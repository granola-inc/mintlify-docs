Customer, not Granola, shall have sole responsibility for the accuracy, quality, integrity, legality, reliability, appropriateness, and intellectual property ownership or right to use of all Customer Data including, without limitation, Customer’s compliance with all applicable Recording Laws. Customer represents and warrants that it has all rights and/or consents necessary to provide the Customer Data to Granola as contemplated hereunder, in each case without any infringement, violation or misappropriation of any third party rights (including, without limitation, intellectual property rights and rights of privacy). Customer hereby grants to Granola a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide license to reproduce, distribute, and otherwise use and display the Customer Data and perform all acts with respect to the Customer Data as may be necessary for Granola to provide the Services, and a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, worldwide license to reproduce, distribute, modify, and otherwise use and display Customer Data incorporated within the Business Contact Data and Usage Data. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Granola shall not (and shall not authorize any third party to) use any Customer Data to train any Granola or third-party artificial intelligence or machine learning model except as described below or on an applicable Order Form:
  - 4.5.1. Free Services. Solely with respect to Customer Data related to or arising out of the Free Services, Customer expressly grants Granola and its authorized sub-processors permission to use Customer Data to train Granola’s and its authorized sub-processors artificial intelligence and machine learning models.
  - 4.5.2. Standard Services. Solely with respect to Customer Data related to the Standard Services, unless otherwise specified by Customer through the Services or indicated in applicable Documentation, Customer expressly grants Granola and its authorized sub-processors permission to use Customer Data to train Granola’s and its authorized sub-processors artificial intelligence and machine learning models but only (a) to the extent that such trained models are provided solely for the benefit of Customer and its Authorized Users and not for the benefit of any third party; or (b) through the use of Aggregated De-Identified Data (as defined below) generated from the use of such Customer Data.

- 4.6. Aggregated De-Identified Data. “**Aggregated De-Identified Data**” means data submitted to, collected by, or generated by Granola in connection with Customer’s or an Authorized User’s use of the Services but only in aggregate, de-identified form which can in no way be linked specifically to Customer or an Authorized User. Customer expressly grants Granola permission to use and modify (but not disclose) Customer Data for the purposes of generating Aggregated De-Identified Data for use (a) to the extent permitted in Section 4.5; or (b) freely use, retain and make available Aggregated De-Identified Data for Granola’s solely for Granola’s internal business purposes of improving, testing, and operating Granola’s products and services, including for development, diagnostic and corrective purposes to optimize and maintain performance of the Services. For clarity, such use of Aggregated De-Identified Data pursuant to this Section 4.6 shall not include the training or improvement artificial intelligence or machine learning models which are instead addressed solely as provided for in Section 4.5.
- 4.7. Third Party Integrations. Customer acknowledges and agrees that (i) the Services may operate on, with or using Third Party Integrations, (ii) the availability and operation of the Services or certain portions thereof may be dependent on Granola’s ability to access such Third Party Integrations, and (iii) where applicable, Customer’s failure to provide adequate access or any retraction of permissions relating to such Third Party Integrations may result in a suspension or interruption of the Services. Customer hereby represents and warrants that it has all rights, licenses, permissions and consents necessary to connect, use and access any Third Party Integrations that it integrates with the Services, and Customer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Granola for all claims, damages and liabilities arising out of Customer’s use of any such Third Party Integrations in connection with or through the Services. Granola cannot and does not guarantee that the Services shall incorporate (or continue to incorporate) any particular Third Party Integrations and does not make any representations or warranties with respect to Third Party Integrations. Customer may be responsible for procuring any necessary rights for it to access Third Party Integrations (including any Customer Data or other information relating thereto) and for complying with any applicable terms or conditions thereof, in which case any exchange of data or other interaction between Customer and a third-party provider is solely between Customer and such third party provider is governed by such third party’s terms and conditions. By authorizing Granola to transmit Customer Data from such Third Party Integrations into the Services, Customer represents and warrants to Granola that it has all right, power, and authority to provide such authorization. In the event that Customer accesses the Services through Granola’s iOS applications available via the Apple, Inc. App Store, the additional Application Terms (“**Application Terms**”), available at https://go.granola.so/application-tos, shall apply and are hereby incorporated by reference.
- 4.8. Third Party Models. Customer acknowledges and agrees that Third Party Models are not developed by Granola. While Granola uses commercially reasonable efforts to diligence Third Party Models, Granola does not control or influence the training or hosting of Third Party Models, and is unable to guarantee the suitability, accuracy, quality, security, legality and reliability of Third Party Models, including any outputs there (“**AI Outputs**”). Customer acknowledges that AI Outputs may contain errors and misstatements and may be incomplete or inaccurate. Before leveraging any AI Outputs, Customer or any Authorized User is responsible for making its own determination that the AI Outputs are suitable, and Customer is solely responsible for any reliance on the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of any AI Outputs. Customer agrees that Granola will not be liable for any loss or damages arising from or related to Third Party Models or AI Outputs and shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless Granola with respect to any claims, damages or liability related thereto. Third Party Models may be subject to additional terms and conditions and Customer is solely responsible for complying with such terms and conditions where presented to Customer through the Services. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the warranties and indemnities provided by Granola in this Agreement do not apply with respect to Third Party Models.
- 4.9. Open Source Components. Certain aspects of the Services, such as the Client-Side Software, may contain or be distributed with open source software code or libraries (“**Open Source Components**”). Granola will provide a list of Open Source Components for a particular version of any distributed portion of the Services, such as the Client-Side Software, on Customer’s request. To the extent required by the license applicable to such Open Source Components: (i) Granola will use reasonable efforts to deliver to Customer any notices or other materials (such as source code); and (ii) the terms of such licenses will apply to such Open Source Components in lieu of the terms of this Agreement. To the extent the terms of such licenses prohibit any of the restrictions in this Agreement with respect to any particular Open Source Component, such restrictions will not apply to such Open Source Component. To the extent the terms of such licenses require Granola to make an offer to provide source code or related information in connection with the Open Source Component, such offer is hereby made. For purposes of clarity, Open Source Components are Third Party Integrations as defined in this Agreement.

## 5. Payment.

- 5.1. Fees. Customer will pay all fees specified in Order Forms or as other set forth on Granola’s https://www.granola.ai/pricing (“**Fees**”).

- 5.2. Invoicing and Payment. If Customer pays online via credit or debit card, Customer agrees to be bound by the Stripe, Inc. Services Agreement available at https://stripe.com/us/legal. Customer will provide Granola with valid and updated credit card information, or with a valid purchase order or alternative document reasonably acceptable to Granola. If Customer provides credit card information to Granola, Customer authorizes Granola to charge such credit card for all Services listed in the Order Form for the initial subscription term and any renewal subscription term(s) as set forth in the “Term of Subscriptions” section below. Such charges shall be made in advance, either annually or in accordance with any different billing frequency stated in the applicable Order Form. If the Order Form specifies that payment will be by a method other than a credit card, Granola will invoice Customer in advance and otherwise in accordance with the relevant Order Form. Unless otherwise stated in the Order Form, invoiced fees are due net thirty (30) days from the invoice date. Customer is responsible for providing complete and accurate billing and contact information to Granola and notifying Granola of any changes to such information.
- 5.3. Overdue Charges. If any invoiced amount is not received by Granola by the due date, then without limiting Granola’s rights or remedies, (a) those charges may accrue late interest at the rate of 1.5% of the outstanding balance per month, or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is lower, and/or (b) Granola may condition future subscription renewals and Order Forms on payment terms shorter than those specified in the “Invoicing and Payment” section above.
- 5.4. Suspension of Services and Acceleration. If any charge owing by Customer under this or any other agreement for Services is thirty (30) days or more overdue, (or ten (10) or more days overdue in the case of amounts Customer has authorized Granola to charge to Customer’s credit card), Granola may, without limiting its other rights and remedies, accelerate Customer’s unpaid fee obligations under such agreements so that all such obligations become immediately due and payable, and suspend Services until such amounts are paid in full, provided that, other than for customers paying by credit card or direct debit whose payment has been declined, Granola will give Customer at least ten (10) days’ prior notice that its account is overdue, in accordance with the “Notices” section below for billing notices, before suspending services to Customer.
- 5.5. Overages. If Customer exceeds any Authorized User or usage limitations set forth on an Order Form, then (i) Granola shall invoice Customer for such additional users or usage at the overage rates set forth on the Order Form (or if no overage rates are set forth on the Order Form, at Granola’s then-current standard overage rates for such usage), in each case on a pro-rata basis from the first date of such excess usage through the end of the applicable Subscription Period, and (ii) if the Subscription Period renews (in accordance with Section 8 below), such new Subscription Period shall include the additional fees for such excess Authorized Users and usage.
- 5.6. Payment Disputes. Granola will not exercise its rights under the “Overdue Charges” or “Suspension of Service and Acceleration” section above if Customer is disputing the applicable charges reasonably and in good faith and is cooperating diligently to resolve the dispute.
- 5.7. Taxes. Granola’s fees do not include any taxes, levies, duties or similar governmental assessments of any nature, including, for example, value-added, sales, use or withholding taxes, assessable by any jurisdiction whatsoever (collectively, “**Taxes**”). Customer is responsible for paying all Taxes associated with its purchases hereunder. If Granola has the legal obligation to pay or collect Taxes for which Customer is responsible under this section, Granola will invoice Customer and Customer will pay that amount unless Customer provides Granola with a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority. For clarity, Granola is solely responsible for taxes assessable against it based on its income, property and employees.

## 6. Confidential Information.

- 6.1. Confidential Information. From time to time during the Subscription Period, either party may disclose or make available to the other party information about its business affairs, products, confidential intellectual property, trade secrets, third-party confidential information, and other sensitive or proprietary information, whether orally or in written, electronic, or other form or media that: (i) is marked, designated or otherwise identified as “confidential” or something similar at the time of disclosure or within a reasonable period of time thereafter; or (ii) would be considered confidential by a reasonable person given the nature of the information or the circumstances of its disclosure (collectively, “**Confidential Information**”).

Confidential Information does not include information that, at the time of disclosure is: (a) in the public domain; (b) known to the receiving party at the time of disclosure; (c) rightfully obtained by the receiving party on a non-confidential basis from a third party; or (d) independently developed by the receiving party without use of, reference to, or reliance upon the disclosing party’s Confidential Information.

The receiving party shall not use the disclosing party’s Confidential Information except to perform its obligations and exercise its rights hereunder nor shall it disclose the disclosing party’s Confidential Information to any person or entity, except to the receiving party’s employees, contractors, and agents who have a need to know the Confidential Information for the receiving party to exercise its rights or perform its obligations hereunder (“**Representatives**”). The receiving party will be responsible for all the acts and omissions of its Representatives as they relate to Confidential Information hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party may disclose Confidential Information to the limited extent required (A) in order to comply with the order of a court or other governmental body, or as otherwise necessary to comply with applicable law, provided that the party making the disclosure pursuant to the order shall first have given written notice to the other party and made a reasonable effort to obtain a protective order; or (B) to establish a party’s rights under this Agreement, including to make required court filings.
- 6.3. Effect of Termination or Expiration. Upon expiration or termination of the Agreement, the receiving party shall promptly return to the disclosing party all copies, whether in written, electronic, or other form or media, of the disclosing party’s Confidential Information, or destroy all such copies and certify in writing to the disclosing party that such Confidential Information has been destroyed. Each party’s obligations of non-use and non-disclosure with regard to Confidential Information are effective as of the Effective Date and will expire three (3) years from the date of termination or expiration of this Agreement; provided, however, with respect to any Confidential Information that constitutes a trade secret (as determined under applicable law), such obligations of non-disclosure will survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement until such Confidential Information is no longer considered a trade secret under applicable law through no wrongful act or omission of the receiving party.

## 7. Data Security; Processing of Personal Information.

    - 7.1.  Security Measures. Granola shall use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the security and integrity of the Services and the Customer Data. Granola is not responsible to Customer for unauthorized access to Customer Data or the unauthorized use of the Services unless such access is due to Granola’s gross negligence or willful misconduct.
    - 7.2.  Processing of Personal Data. Granola’s rights and obligations with respect to Personal Data that it collects directly from individuals are set forth in Granola’s [Privacy Policy](https://go.granola.so/privacy). The DPA shall apply to all Personal Data Granola processes on behalf of Customer in connection with the Services.

If this Agreement is terminated by Granola in accordance with the “Termination” section above, Customer will pay any unpaid fees covering the remainder of the term of all Order Forms to the extent permitted by applicable law. In no event will termination relieve Customer of its obligation to pay any fees payable to Granola for the period prior to the effective date of termination.
    - 8.5.  Suspension. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Granola may temporarily suspend Customer’s and any Authorized User’s access to any portion or all of the Services if: (i) Granola reasonably determines that (a) there is a threat or attack on any of Granola IP; (b) Customer’s or any Authorized User’s use of Granola IP disrupts or poses a security risk to Granola IP or to any other customer or vendor of Granola; (c) Customer, or any Authorized User, is using Granola IP for fraudulent or illegal activities; (d) subject to applicable law, Customer has ceased to continue its business in the ordinary course, made an assignment for the benefit of creditors or similar disposition of its assets, or become the subject of any bankruptcy, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution, or similar proceeding; (e) Granola’s provision of the Services to Customer or any Authorized User is prohibited by applicable law; or (f) any Customer Data submitted, posted, or otherwise transmitted by or on behalf of Customer or an Authorized User through the Services may infringe or otherwise violate any third party’s intellectual property or other rights; (ii) any vendor of Granola has suspended or terminated Granola’s access to or use of any Third Party Integrations required to enable Customer to access the Services; or (iii) Customer’s account is more than ten (10) days past due as further set forth in Section 6.4 (any such suspension due to Customer’s failure to pay applicable Fees, a “**Services Suspension**”). Granola shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide written notice of any Services Suspension to Customer and to provide updates regarding resumption of access to the Services following any Services Suspension.

If such a claim is made or appears possible, Customer agrees to permit Granola, at Granola’s sole discretion: to (i) modify or replace the Services, or component or part thereof, to make it non-infringing; or (ii) obtain the right for Customer to continue use. If Granola determines that neither alternative is reasonably commercially available, Granola may terminate this Agreement, in its entirety or with respect to the affected component or part, effective immediately on written notice to Customer.

    - 9.3.  Sole Remedy. THIS SECTION 9 SETS FORTH CUSTOMER’S SOLE REMEDIES AND GRANOLA’S SOLE LIABILITY AND OBLIGATION FOR ANY ACTUAL, THREATENED, OR ALLEGED CLAIMS THAT THE SERVICES INFRINGE, MISAPPROPRIATE, OR OTHERWISE VIOLATE ANY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF ANY THIRD PARTY.

## 12. General Provisions.

- 12.1. Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including all Order Forms and Statements of Work) represents the entire agreement between Customer and Granola with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals (whether oral, written or electronic) between Customer and Granola with respect thereto. The parties agree that any term or condition stated in a Customer purchase order or in any other Customer order documentation (excluding Order Forms) is void. In the event of any conflict or inconsistency among the following documents, the order of precedence shall be: (1) the applicable Order Form, (2) this Agreement, (3) the Application Terms and (4) the Documentation. Titles and headings of sections of this Agreement are for convenience only and shall not affect the construction of any provision of this Agreement.

- 12.2. Export Regulation. The Services may utilize software and technology that may be subject to US export control laws, including the US Export Administration Act and its associated regulations.

- 12.11. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.
- 12.12. Waiver. The failure of either party to act with respect to a breach of this Agreement by the other party shall not constitute a waiver and shall not limit such party’s rights with respect to such breach or any subsequent breaches.
- 12.13. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Agreement. The parties shall use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Agreement directly through good-faith negotiations, which shall be a precondition to either party initiating arbitration. If such negotiations do not resolve the dispute, it shall be finally settled by binding arbitration in New York, New York. The arbitration will proceed in the English language, in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the “**Rules**”) then in effect, by one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes. The arbitrator shall be selected from the appropriate list of JAMS arbitrators in accordance with such Rules. Judgment upon the award rendered by such arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. The Rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees. For users of Free Services, Granola will pay all arbitration fees for claims less than seventy-five thousand ($75,000) dollars and such users shall have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Section by sending written notice of the decision to opt out to the address listed in Section 12.5 (Notices) postmarked within thirty (30) days of first accepting this Agreement. Customer must include (i) its name and residence address, (ii) the email address and/or telephone number associated with its account, and (iii) a clear statement that it wants to opt out of this arbitration agreement. THE PARTIES WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR JURY. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS. CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.

- 12.14. Injunctive Relief. Notwithstanding the foregoing obligation to arbitrate disputes, each party shall have the right to pursue injunctive or other equitable relief at any time, from any court of competent jurisdiction, to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights.
- 12.15. Exclusive Venue. In the event the arbitration agreement does not apply, and the parties agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions) will be brought in the state or federal courts located in, respectively, New York, New York, or the federal district in which that county falls.
