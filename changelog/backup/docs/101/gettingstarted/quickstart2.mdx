## Step 2: Launch Granola

Open **Granola** from Applications. You may see a warning:  
> "Granola is from the internet. Are you sure you want to open it?"  
Click **Open**. Then follow any prompts to grant microphone or screen permissions if requested.

## Step 3: Sign in & Connect Calendar

Granola will prompt you to **Sign in with Google**. (Right now, we only fully support Google Workspace for frictionless calendar integration.)

1. **Accept terms & privacy policy**.  
2. **Choose** the Google account you’ll use for your meeting notes.  
3. **Grant** Granola the requested permissions so it can read your calendar and prep your notes.

## Step 4: Test it Out

> **Pro Tip**: Schedule a low-stakes meeting on your calendar or start an impromptu Slack/Zoom call to see how Granola captures notes in real-time.

- Open **Granola** and choose the meeting.
- Wait for Granola’s live transcript to appear (you might get a pop-up asking for microphone permissions).
- See your transcript appear line by line in Granola’s interface or note editor.

## Step 5: Explore the Key Features

- **Taking Notes**: You can type notes in the editor while the transcript runs.  
- **Enhance**: When the meeting ends, Granola automatically generates a polished set of notes.  
- **Share**: Generate a shareable link or copy to Slack/Email.  
- **Ask Granola**: Summaries, action items, or Q&A from your transcript.
