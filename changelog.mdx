# v5.267.0 (2025-02-20)

- You can now drag the “Nub” (the small floating window) to a preferred spot on your screen.
Bug Fixes
- We've reworked some code and you should see snappier performance during quick interactions.
- **Bugfix:** If you lose system audio connection (e.g., unplugging an external monitor), Granola now restarts audio capture automatically to keep transcription going.

# v5.263.0 (2025-02-18)

- We've made it easier for Business users to move to an Enterprise plan with on-screen guidance.
- Previously, if you deleted all text in your enhanced summary, Granola would jump back to your raw notes view. Now you can keep an empty summary or retype as you wish.
- Granola’s notifications will appear above your system’s alerts so you’re less likely to miss transcription prompts.
- **Bugfix:** Fixed an issue where refreshing the page mid-transcription could break the audio capture. Now transcription resumes gracefully, even if you reload the window.

# v5.256.0 (2025-02-13)

- We now display a brief reminder to request consent before transcribing a call. It’s always visible in the transcript view so you don’t forget best practices.
- Organizations can self-serve an upgrade to Enterprise from within the app (if applicable to your account).
- Enterprise admins can enable a new Privacy Mode that limits certain data or note visibility across a team.
- Fixed some subtitle text color/size issues for better readability.
