### Platform Availability ü§†

Granola currently runs on Mac, with an ios app in development. While we don't have specific release dates, we maintain a [waitlist for ](https://tally.so/r/3EXKgL?utm_source=email%2Cweb)[the Windows version](https://tally.so/r/3EXKgL?utm_source=email%2Cweb). If you join the waitlist, you will be the first to hear when we are building functionality for windows. You can stay updated on new platform releases through:

* Our [Slack community channels](https://join.slack.com/t/meetgranola/shared_invite/zt-2toq0kcts-uaUMQMWkeVMWSk4N_EhZ7A)

* Email updates

* [Twitter announcements](https://x.com/meetgranola)

If you're interested in beta testing future platforms, you can join our Slack community and contact our team directly.

### Email & Login Options

Granola is designed for professional teams and works best with company email accounts. When signing up, you'll use your Google Workspace account for seamless calendar integration and meeting management.

<Info>
  If you try to sign up with your personal Google account, you will be added to our waitlist and given access to the platform anywhere between two minutes and four weeks.&#x20;
</Info>

### Calendar Integration

Currently, Granola only offers full native support for Google Calendar. Granola integrates with your calendar for three critical reasons:

1. Granola sends notifications reminding you to join meetings and take notes

2. It uses context from calendar events to ensure your meeting notes are useful to you

3. You can add notes ahead of or to prepare for a meeting when Granola is integrated with your calendar

<Info>
  &#x20;For Outlook users, you can try this workaround that involves linking your Outlook calendar to Google Calendar. The success of this depends on your organization's IT policies ‚Äì some companies may restrict calendar sharing between platforms.
</Info>

Granola only supports multiple calendars through your primary account. To access multiple calendars:

1. Share additional calendars with your primary Google account

2. In Granola, hover over "Coming Up" and click the Settings cog

3. Toggle visibility for your additional calendars

If you're experiencing calendar visibility issues, first check your calendar settings in Granola. Sometimes the app may default to the wrong calendar if you have multiple ones shared with your account.---
title: Templates
description: "Create your own templates or choose from our library for recurrent meeting types"
icon: file-lines
iconType: thin
---

Templates in Granola are a nifty way to make sure your notes are returned consistently in the most helpful way for you. 

### Accessing the templates feature:

Open your Granola app and navigate to the ‚ÄúEnhance‚Äù menu within your notes. This is where all your templates and enhancements can be managed. There's a built in library of common meeting types for you to start with, or to be inspired by.&#x20;

![title](/images/gifs/livet2.gif)

### Creating a new template:

* In the ‚ÄúEnhance‚Äù menu, click on ‚ÄúAll Templates.‚Äù

* Select ‚ÄúCreate Template‚Äù to start a new template document.

### Designing your template

* Start by writing a description of the purpose of the meeting, you might want to put specific instructions about the level of detail you want ("Include quotes, numbers and data wherever mentioned", or a description of the meeting, "This is a user interview, I am trying to understand what the user thinks about my product, Granola, an AI note-taking tool for meetings")

* Then outline the structure which is the most useful for your meetings. Common elements might include:

  * Key Discussion Points

  * Decisions Made

  * Action Items or Follow-ups

* Of course, you can also be much more specific with your headers. A user interview template for Granola might include

  * What are their current note taking tools?

  * How do they share their notes?&#x20;

  * Who introduced Granola to the team and how did they share it?&#x20;

### Applying templates to meetings

* Once created, templates can be applied to any future meetings, which will let you have more focused note taking during the meeting.&#x20;

### Sharing templates with your team

* You can share templates with your team so you can all benefit from consistent notes. Just go to the template's page and click where it says "Private to me", and change to "Shared with \[your company]" This will share your template with anyone using Granola who has the same company domain as you, so be certain you want everyone to have access to it before sharing it. ![](Screenshot2024-12-17at13.26.28.png)

### **Best practices**

* Test your templates to ensure they meet all your needs during a meeting. Adjust as needed to improve workflow and efficiency.

* Share templates with team members to maintain uniformity in notes across your organization.---
title: Editing your enhanced notes
description: "Everything you can do to your meeting notes to make them great"
icon: pen-to-square
iconType: thin
---

### What happens when I finish a call?

Once Granola recognises that a call has ended, it will automatically enhance your notes using the default format. This format is designed to create the best possible notes without the additional context of a custom template.

If you have typed your own notes, the enhanced notes will be both grey and black. The black notes are notes that have been brought through from your own notes, and the grey notes are notes that have been added by Granola.

### Understanding where the enhanced notes come from

Because LLMs aren't always reliable, Granola includes two tools to help you investigate your enhanced notes to feel confident in them:

1. Use the magnifying glass beside each note to see where in the transcript or raw notes the note came from

2. Use Ask Granola (cmnd+F) to pull out quotes from the transcript that support the point you're investigating

### Editing your notes after they've been enhanced

Even after Granola has generated your meeting notes, you can still change them, either by editing the enhanced notes directly, or by returning to the raw notes and editing them there, before re-enhancing them.

* #### Editing the enhanced notes directly

  * You can just directly click on any note and edit it. If a note was grey because it was added by Granola, it will turn black to show that you authored it.

* #### Editing the raw notes

  * You can also return to the raw notes and edit them there, before re-enhancing them. Be careful though, this will completely regenerate the enhanced notes, so if you have made any changes to the enhanced notes, they will be lost.

### Using templates

Once your meeting is finished, you can apply a template to your notes. This is especially helpful if you have lots of recurring meetings and you want to keep your notes consistent.---

Sharing your notes and meeting summaries with Granola is straightforward and secure. Here‚Äôs how you can effectively manage sharing features:

### Basic Sharing

Granola allows you to share your meeting notes with colleagues and team members. Sharing is done through custom-generated links that you can easily manage within the app settings.&#x20;

### Generating sharing links

When you sign up to Granola, sharing links will automatically be turned on by default.&#x20;

1. Access your note or summary you wish to share.

2. Click the "Share" button.

3. You'll receive a unique URL that you can distribute to others, granting them view-only access to the content.

4. They'll be able to "Ask Granola" more questions about the meeting

### Turning off sharing links by default

1. Navigate to your settings in Granola.

2. Click "Enable sharing links" on or off, depending on your preferences.

### Turn sharing links on and off per set of notes

In each set of notes, you can turn link sharing on and off. This means that if you've shared a link with someone and you no longer want them to access it, you can disable the link they have.

* If your links are default switched off, you can click "Create link" to generate a new link

* If you want to turn off a link that has been shared publicly, click the drop down arrow beside "Copy link" and select "Disable link"

![](/images/linksharing.gif)

### Auto-sharing notes

Granola prioritizes your privacy, and does not auto-share your notes to attendees.&#x20;

* Notes and summaries remain private unless you manually create a share link.

* You can control who accesses your content by deciding when and with whom to share your link.

*

title: Automatic Consent Messaging

icon: arrows-to-circle
iconType: thin
---
Granola offers a way to automatically share a message with the participants of your meeting using the inbuilt chat function in Teams and Zoom. 

### Setting Consent Messaging up

If you navigate to the settings tab in Granola, navigate to the Labs tab and find the "Enable sharing links" toggle

![consentmessage](/images/consent1-1.png)

When you toggle it on for the first time, a security dialog will pop up with the quite scary request to "control your computer"

![consentmessage](/images/consent2.png)

The way we've built this feature requires that we can control which window is foregrounded and run some related processes in the background. This is the only part of Granola that requires this permission, we do not use it elsewhere in the app. 

![consentmessage](/images/consent1-2.png)

Once you've granted this permission, you'll see a text entry box. You can either use our default consent notice, or write your own. 

Now, every time you have a meeting in Google Meet or Zoom, your consent message will automatically send in the chat window of your meeting. 

![consentmessage](/images/consent-message.png)

### Troubleshooting

## Loom

If you have Loom running when you're on Granola, it will break this functionality unless you switch off the keyboard shortcut for confetti. 

Open up the Loom widget and click on the three dots to open the settings. 

![consentmessage](/images/loom-settings.png)

Open up Preferences and x out of the keyboard shortcut for confetti

### How Granola captures transcription

Granola passes audio directly from your meetings to our transcription provider for the purpose of transcription. It does not record or save audio or video at any point during the call.&#x20;

### Speaker identification system¬†

The speaker identification system in Granola uses advanced algorithms to differentiate between voices. Although it does not log speaker information explicitly, it does its best to maintain accuracy in identifying turn-taking and dialogue splits within the transcription output. We provide additional tools once the meeting has ended to help you feel confident in Granola's output.&#x20;

### In-person meetings

Granola works remarkably well for in-person meetings, but because the app uses system audio, the transcript will register everyone as just one person speaking, so it is a less reliable feature. However, while processing, Granola is fairly good at identifying who has spoken, and so the notes are still great - although if you want to help Granola out, you can be sure to use peoples' names during the call.&#x20;

We're building an ios app that's designed for in-person meetings and has enhanced voice recognition and diarization functionality, [**join the waitlist here**](https://www.granola.ai/app).&#x20;

### When does transcription begin?

For a calendar event, Granola begins transcribing only when you have opened a set of meeting notes, and only from the start time of the calendar event. You can choose to start transcription manually if you want to start it earlier. &#x20;

It does not auto-transcribe any call without you manually clicking into it, either through the notification that pops up, or from the home screen.&#x20;

If you have an impromptu meeting that is not attached to a calendar event, such a Slack huddle, transcription will begin as soon as you open the set of notes, or click on the impromptu meeting notification.&#x20;

### When does transcription end?

Transcription ends under these circumstances:

* You exit out of your set of notes (the notes must be open to ensure transcription)

* You manually end the transcription by clicking the stop button

* Granola automatically recognises that the meeting has ended

* Granola identifies that there has been a long period of silence

### Resuming transcription

If your transcription has ended, you can resume it by opening the transcription window and clicking resume in the top right hand corner.&#x20;

![](SCR-20241213-nhru.png)

### Dancing bars

The green dancing bars show when Granola is actively transcribing. Occasionally, if your network connection drops or Granola detects silence for too long, transcription may stop. You can resume transcription and open the live transcript window to check that it's working again.

### Viewing the transcript

Open your live transcript at any time during the meeting by clicking the "dancing bars" icon. This lets you:

* See what's being captured in real-time

* Verify audio is working correctly

* Review recent discussion points

<Info>
  The live transcription may not be 100% accurate, but the quality of the notes shouldn't be affected by what you see being generated live, as long as it's picking up both mic and system audio.&#x20;
</Info>

### How can I query a live meeting?

Use cmnd+S to open the Ask Granola sidebar and ask questions of the transcript up til the point you're asking. It can help you catch up on missed details or inform a question you need to ask. Sample questions might be:

* "In bullet points, what did I just miss?"

* "What did David say about SOC2 compliance at the start of the meeting?"&#x20;

* "Can you list all the actions I've agreed to take in this meeting so far?"&#x20;

### Exporting the transcript

You can copy/paste the transcript to another platform by opening the transcript and clicking on the clipboard button.&#x20;

![](Screenshot2024-12-17at12.04.20.png)

### Common Transcription Issues¬†

Several issues can impact the quality and timeliness of Granola's transcription:

* **Quiet microphone input**: If Granola is failing to pick up what you're saying correctly, make sure your mic input volume is set to maximum through your computer's system audio settings.

* **Delayed transcripts**: This can happen if there are temporary disconnects or slow internet speeds affecting the transcription feed‚Äôs processing time

* **Intermittent transcription stops**: This may occur due to hardware conflicts or system resource limitations on your computer. Check your system audio settings are correct, that you're not accessing Granola through a restrictive VPN or that your company's IT system isn't too limited. 

* **Linguistic accuracy**: When meetings are conducted in multiple languages or accents not supported by the current version of Granola, transcription may not accurately capture the dialogue

To make sure your transcription is being captured accurately, open up the transcription box during the call, and keep Granola as a sidebar during your call.&#x20;

### FAQs

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why doesn't the transcript show exactly who is speaking?" defaultOpen={false}>
    Our system uses system audio and microphone audio to distinguish between speakers ("me" vs "them") without needing a meeting bot in your calls. As a result, your transcripts will only distinguish between audio that comes from your mic vs your system audio and real-time speaker identification remains technically challenging.

    We offer two tools to help you get the information you need from the transcripts:

    * A zoom in function in your enhanced notes for detailed transcript review

    * An Ask Granola chat for transcript analysis and information retrieval&#x20;

    While speaker identification works better in post-processing, live identification is more complex. Though this technology is advancing quickly, implementation depends on industry-wide progress. For now, we're focusing on providing reliable live transcription and useful analysis tools. We expect both the technology and Granola's transcription to improve rapidly.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How can I access the video or audio from my meeting?" defaultOpen={false}>
    Granola does not record or store audio or video of your meetings. We pass your audio through to our transcription service and receive the transcription back. At no point is there an accessible audio file from your meetings.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="My transcription ended randomly during a meeting" defaultOpen={false}>
    We're working on a bug which means that transcriptions fails when you access Granola through a VPN, on some managed computers or with some complex audio/mic setups. Please email hey@granola.so with your bug report to help us fix this. Let us know:

    * Are you using a VPN?

    * Are you on a managed laptop?

    * Can you confirm that transcription began? (Did you open the transcription box and see that it was capturing your words?)

    * Do you have an external mic / complex audio set up?
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I want to fix the transcript" defaultOpen={false}>
    Right now that's not possible on Granola, although we recognise that it could be a very useful feature! Workarounds include editing your raw notes to include the correction and editing the final enhanced notes to ensure everything is accurate.&#x20;

### The Granola note editor

Your notes editor enables you to write your own notes that help guide Granola when generating your enhanced meeting notes.&#x20;

* Type your own notes

* Add context to the conversation

* Mark important moments

You can format your notes in real time using Markdown:&#x20;

* Type # for headers

* Use \* for bullet points

* Add **bold** with asterisks


<Info>
  You *do not need to write your own notes.* Even if you don't write any notes at all, Granola will generate a great summary using context from the transcript and your event. You can even apply a template after the notes are generated if you want to have more control over the output.
</Info>

### Adding headers to create structure

Granola will always take your notes into account when generating your meeting notes, but during your call, you might want to ensure that certain sections are pulled through in your enhanced notes.&#x20;

Any header you add by typing # at the beginning of your sentence will become a section header in your final meeting notes.&#x20;

### Adding images as context

You can easily add images to your notes by capturing screenshots or attachments during your meetings and dragging and dropping the images into your notes editor. For now, you can only see the images in the raw notes version of the app, but the context contained within the images will be added to enhance your Granola notes.&#x20;

There's a limit of ten images per set of notes.&#x20;

<Info>
  For now Granola can only upload JPG and PNG files, we're looking at adding more file types, including PDFs, in the future.
</Info>

### Keyboard Shortcuts

Speed up your note-taking:

* ‚åòN: New note

* ‚åòF: Ask Granola

* ‚åòB: Bold text

Granola seamlessly integrates with Google Calendar to display your upcoming meetings. Here's how to set it up:

### Calendar integration

Currently, Granola only offers full native support for Google Calendar. Granola integrates with your calendar for three critical reasons:

1. Granola sends notifications reminding you to join meetings and take notes

2. It uses context from calendar events to ensure your meeting notes are useful to you

3. You can add notes ahead of or to prepare for a meeting when Granola is integrated with your calendar

<Info>
  &#x20;For Outlook users, we provide a [**workaround**](/docs/101/gettingstarted/21Outlookintegration) that involves linking your Outlook calendar to Google Calendar. The success of this workaround depends on your organization's IT policies ‚Äì some companies may restrict calendar sharing between platforms.figjam
</Info>

### **First-time setup**

* Sign in to Granola using your Google Workspace account.

* When prompted, grant the necessary calendar access permissions.

* Allow a few seconds for your meetings to sync.

* Verify the sync by checking your "Coming Up" section.

<Info>
  Granola requires calendar permissions to do two things

  * Send you notifications when there are upcoming meetings

  * Use context from the calendar to help generate better notes

  It is possible to use Granola without integrating your calendar, but the experience will be more manual and the notes will be less high quality.&#x20;
</Info>

### **Support for multiple calendars**


Granola only supports multiple calendars through your primary account. To access multiple calendars:

1. [Share additional calendars](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/37082?hl=en) with your primary Google account

2. In Granola, hover over "Coming Up" and click the Settings cog

3. Toggle visibility for your additional calendars

If you're experiencing calendar visibility issues, first check your calendar settings in Granola. Sometimes the app may default to the wrong calendar if you have multiple ones shared with your account.

### **Checking calendar connection**

* Click on the settings cog next to "Coming Up".

* Make sure your primary calendar is selected.

* Turn on any additional calendars you wish to view.

* Confirm that your upcoming meetings are displaying correctly.

### **Managing multiple calendars**

* Granola doesn't support multiple direct logins, but you can still access multiple calendars:

  1. Share additional calendars with your primary Google account.

  2. Accept these shared calendars in Google Calendar.

  3. In Granola, access the settings cog next to "Coming Up" to toggle visibility for additional calendars.

  4. Changes in calendar visibility take immediate effect.

### **Working with Outlook**

While Granola is optimized for Google Calendar, you can join [this waiting list](https://tally.so/r/wzWb78) to be the first to hear about an Outlook integration - until then, Outlook users can use a workaround:

* **Outlook integration steps:**

  1. Link your Outlook calendar to Google Calendar.

  2. Use Granola with your Google account.

  3. Meetings should now appear from both calendars.

*Note:*¬†This workaround's success may depend on your organization's IT policies.

### **Common calendar issues**

* **No Events Showing:**¬†If no meetings are visible,

  1. Check if the wrong calendar is selected by default.

  2. Verify your primary calendar is selected under "Coming Up".

  3. Toggle other calendars as needed.

* **Calendar sync problems:**¬†If you're experiencing sync issues,

  1. Ensure you are using the latest version of Granola.

  2. Double-check calendar permissions in Google.

  3. Consider signing out and back in.

  4. Contact support at hey@granola.so if problems persist.

* **IT restrictions:**¬†Check if internal security settings affect your calendar integration by:

  1. Consulting your IT department about third-party calendar access.

  2. Verifying VPN settings that might impact connection.

  3. Requesting necessary permissions if required.

### **Best practices:**

* **Regular Checks:**¬†Regularly verify if your calendar is syncing correctly.

* **Setup Tips:**

  1. Use your main work calendar as default.

  2. Only turn on the calendars you actively need.

For additional support or inquiries, feel free to reach out at [hey@granola.so](mailto:hey@granola.so) or join our Slack community.

### FAQs

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Is there a way to use my Mac local calendar?" defaultOpen={false}>
    For now, Granola primarily relies on online integrations but recognises that this is a limitation for users with restricted online calendar access due to company policies. We're interested in exploring the use of local calendars, but this feature is not yet part of the current functionality.&#x20;
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I add multiple gmail accounts to one Granola account?" defaultOpen={false}>
    Not yet, but if you share your [gmail calendars](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/37082?hl=en) with each other, you can access all your events from one Granola account. Some organization's IT policies won't allow this, so check with your IT administrator first of all.&#x20;
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I didn't enable Calendar permissions when I signed up, help!" defaultOpen={false}>
    If you quit Granola completely by tapping on the small Granola g in the top bar across your screen, and reopen it, you'll be prompted to give calendar permission again when you log back in.&#x20;
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What should I do if my Google Calendar events aren't syncing with Granola?" defaultOpen={false}>
    First check that you've given Granola the right permissions. If you log out, then quit Granola completely by tapping on the small Granola g in the top bar across your screen, you'll be prompted to give calendar permissions again when you log back in. 
    
    If your calendar permissions are set up correctly, make sure your company's IT policy allows for calendar integrations into apps, and that the VPN you're on isn't restricting access in any way. 
    
    If the problem still persists, report a bug through the Granola settings window.&#x20;
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>


Ensure you‚Äôve granted all necessary permissions for Granola to access your calendar. Double-check that your account settings in Granola are linked correctly. Reach out to support if issues persist[4].

### Account setup FAQs


<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I sign up with my personal Gmail account?">
    Granola is designed for a professional company environment, so for now, we're focusing on developing it for teams.

    If you prefer to sign up with a personal account, you'll be added to a waitlist for approval. We periodically invite groups from the waitlist to join, but it might take anywhere from a few minutes to a few weeks
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I sign up with Outlook or another email platform?">
    We‚Äôre trying to make the experience as good as possible for Google users for now, but expanding the platform to serve other platforms is in the roadmap. Join [the waitlist](https://google.com).

    In the meantime, [this workaround](/docs/integrations/using-granola-with-outlook.mdmx) works for some people who have Outlook accounts. It depends how strict your IT department is though.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use Granola on Windows?">
    Not just yet, but you can join [our waitlist](https://go.granola.so/windows) and do keep an eye on our Twitter page for announcements around our latest product releases.

Granola transcribes your computer audio in realtime. It does not¬†store¬†recorded¬†audio or video. Instead, it saves the transcript and uses it to enhance your notes.¬†For more information about how Granola collects, uses, and stores transcripts and other data, please see Granola‚Äôs Privacy Policy, located at¬†[www.granola.so/pp](https://www.granola.so/pp).

Depending on where¬†your meeting¬†participants¬†are located,¬†you may need to get¬†consent¬†from participants in meetings¬†prior to¬†using Granola¬†to transcribe.¬†You can find more information on recording laws state by state¬†[here](https://url.us.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/9qhYCpYmqOfOpRJnfDYFqL?domain=justia.com/).¬†Please note, this is a third-party resource and Granola is not responsible for the accuracy of third-party websites.

Ultimately, you are responsible for obtaining consent from¬†participants¬†where required¬†by law.¬†Regardless of whether you are legally required to do so, we¬†strongly¬†recommend that¬†you¬†always ask for consent¬†before¬†transcribing.---

### Multi-language Support

Multi-language support is a highly requested feature and we're actively exploring ways to incorporate this in 2025, but we are dependent on when our transcription provider releases new languages and can't control this ourselves. It's likely that the world's most-used languages will be prioritized. You can register your interest in hearing about when we launch languages [here](https://tally.so/r/mDAZlZ)

### Automatic start for all meetings

The ability to opt into automatically starting Granola for all meetings is under consideration. We're mindful of the complexities this might cause when people accidentally transcribe meetings or moments that they didn't want to be transcribed, and so we want to build better functionality around deleting or editing transcripts first.&#x20;

### Automatic export to Notion

This is our most requests integration and as Notion users ourselves, we hear you! Right now we're focusing on organizing notes on-platform better, but more integrations is something we're evaluating for 2025.&#x20;

### Mobile or tablet version of Granola

It's coming! Join the waitlist [here](https://www.granola.ai/app)!

### Windows support

It's coming! Join the waitlist [here](https://tally.so/r/3EXKgL)!

### Add templates before the meeting

We've experimented with this as a feature and we haven't found a way for it to not interrupt the flow of your own notes during the call. We're still looking into whether we can make this work, as we understand having prompts for interviews or regular calls would be helpful!

### Better in-app sharing

Better team functionality including sharing notes with your team is a priority for us in early 2025! Keep an eye out for updates on this front.;

### Querying all meetings

We think this is one of the most helpful things Granola is going to be able to do, and we're working on it as a priority.

### Guide to Perfect Bug Reporting for Granola

To ensure our development team can address any technical issues effectively, it's vital to provide detailed and clear bug reports. Follow these guidelines to create a perfect bug report:

1. Clear Description of the Issue:

Begin with a brief summary of the problem. Clearly state what isn't working as expected. Avoid vague statements such as "It's broken," and instead use specifics like "Granola fails to sync meetings when VPN is active".

2. Steps to Reproduce:

Provide a step-by-step account of how you encountered the issue. This should be detailed enough that someone else could follow and experience the bug themselves.

3. Expected vs. Actual Results:

Clearly outline what you expected to happen versus what actually occurred. This helps the team understand the discrepancy and identify potential causes.

4. Include Screenshots or Videos:

Visual evidence can often expedite the troubleshooting process. Include screenshots or short video clips that capture the bug in action.

5. Device and System Information:

Specify the hardware (such as MacBook or Dell laptops) and the operating system you are using. Include version numbers wherever possible as some bugs may be specific to certain setups.

6. Recent Changes or Updates:

Mention if there were any recent changes such as software updates or configuration changes prior to the issue beginning. This information can help trace the origin.

7. Severity and Frequency:

Indicate how severe the issue is (e.g., minor annoyance vs. critical blocker) and how often it occurs. This helps prioritize fixes.

8. Log Files or Error Messages:

If applicable, attach logs or specific error messages that appear when the bug is triggered. These provide critical insights for developers.

9. Additional Environment Details:

Detail any running background processes, VPN use, or third-party applications that might interact with Granola.

10. Report Through Proper Channels:

Use the in-app 'Send Feedback' option under 'Settings' to report the issue, ensuring it is logged systematically for tracking.

By adhering to these guidelines, you can provide comprehensive and helpful reports. These are crucial for our engineering team to diagnose, replicate, and address issues efficiently, ensuring Granola continues to serve your needs optimally.

As a rule, keep your macOS and your Granola up to date,
because we're finding and fixing bugs all the time.

### Problem: Transcription won't start

If Granola quickly switches from "dancing bars" to a spinning wheel,
and no transcript appears in the transcript window,
this usually means that Granola can't connect to our transcription API.

Common causes and potential fixes:

- For some users, Granola cannot resolve the domain name for our transcription API.
  Try [using `8.8.8.8` as your DNS server.](https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/using#macos)
- For some users, Granola cannot establish a [TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) connection to our APIs.
  Things we have seen that work:

  - turn off your VPN
  - remove untrusted certificates from Keychain

- For some users, some connections are dropped or time out.
  Try adjusting or removing your firewall.

### Problem: Notes won't enhance

If Granola is stuck on "enhancing notes",
it usually means that Granola can't connect to our "enhance notes" API.

Common causes and potential fixes:

- For some users, Granola cannot resolve the domain name for our transcription API.
  Try [using `8.8.8.8` as your DNS server.](https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/using#macos)
- For some users, Granola cannot establish a [TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security connection to our APIs.
  Things we have seen that work:

  - turn off your VPN
  - remove untrusted certificates from Keychain

- For some users, some connections are dropped or time out.
  Try adjusting or removing your firewall.

### Problem: I can't see my calendar events

If Granola is not keeping your calendar up to date,
it usually means that Granola can't connect to our calendar API.

Common causes and potential fixes:

- For some users, Granola cannot resolve the domain name for our transcription API.
  Try [using `8.8.8.8` as your DNS server.](https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/using#macos)
- For some users, Granola cannot establish a TLS connection to our APIs.
  Things we have seen that work:

  - turn off your VPN
  - remove untrusted certificates from Keychain

- For some users, some connections are dropped or time out.
  Try adjusting or removing your firewall.

### Problem: When I have Granola open, it slows typing into other applications

If you're on macOS 15.1, try updating to 15.2 or above.

### Problem: When I have Granola open, Zoom or other meeting platforms lag

Try updating to macOS 15.2 or above.

# 2. Relationship of the Parties; Processing of Data

* 2.1 The parties acknowledge and agree that with regard to the processing of Personal Data, Customer may act either as a controller or processor and, except as expressly set forth in this DPA or the Agreement, Granola is a processor. Customer shall, in its use of the Services, at all times process Personal Data, and provide instructions for the processing of Personal Data, in compliance with Data Protection Laws. Customer shall ensure that the processing of Personal Data in accordance with Customer‚Äôs instructions will not cause Granola to be in breach of the Data Protection Laws. Customer is solely responsible for the accuracy, quality, and legality of (i) the Personal Data provided to Granola by or on behalf of Customer, (ii) the means by which Customer acquired any such Personal Data, and (iii) the instructions it provides to Granola regarding the processing of such Personal Data. Customer shall not provide or make available to Granola any Personal Data in violation of the Agreement or otherwise inappropriate for the nature of the Services, and shall indemnify Granola from all claims and losses in connection therewith.

* 2.2 Granola shall not process Personal Data (i) for purposes other than those set forth in the Agreement and/or Exhibit A, (ii) in a manner inconsistent with the terms and conditions set forth in this DPA or any other documented instructions provided by Customer, including with regard to transfers of personal data to a third country or an international organization, unless required to do so by Supervisory Authority to which Granola is subject; in such a case, Granola shall inform Customer of that legal requirement before processing, unless that law prohibits such information on important grounds of public interest, or (iii) in violation of Data Protection Laws. Customer hereby instructs Granola to process Personal Data in accordance with the foregoing and as part of any processing initiated by Customer in its use of the Services.

* 2.3 The subject matter, nature, purpose, and duration of this processing, as well as the types of Personal Data collected and categories of Data Subjects, are described in Exhibit A to this DPA.

* 2.4 Following completion of the Services, at Customer‚Äôs choice, Granola shall return or delete Customer‚Äôs Personal Data, unless further storage of such Personal Data is required or authorized by applicable law. If return or destruction is impracticable or prohibited by law, rule or regulation, Granola shall take measures to block such Personal Data from any further processing (except to the extent necessary for its continued hosting or processing required by law, rule or regulation) and shall continue to appropriately protect the Personal Data remaining in its possession, custody, or control. If Customer and Granola have entered into Standard Contractual Clauses as described in Section 6 (Transfers of Personal Data), the parties agree that the certification of deletion of Personal Data that is described in Clause 8.1(d) and Clause 8.5 of the EU SCCs (as applicable) shall be provided by Granola to Customer only upon Customer‚Äôs request.

* 2.5 U.S. State Privacy Laws. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the processing of personal information or personal data that is subject to the CCPA, VCDPA, CPA, CTDPA, UCPA, MCDPA, OCPA, or TDPSA shall be carried out in accordance with the terms set forth in Exhibit D.

# 3. Confidentiality

Granola shall ensure that any person it authorizes to process Personal Data has agreed to protect Personal Data in accordance with Granola‚Äôs confidentiality obligations in the Agreement. Customer agrees that Granola may disclose Personal Data to its advisers, auditors or other third parties as reasonably required in connection with the performance of its obligations under this DPA, the Agreement, or the provision of Services to Customer.

# 4. Authorized Subprocessors

* 4.1 Customer acknowledges and agrees that Granola may (1) engage its Affiliates and the Authorized Subprocessors listed in Exhibit B to this DPA to access and process Personal Data in connection with the Services and (2) from time to time engage additional third parties for the purpose of providing the Services, including without limitation the processing of Personal Data. By way of this DPA, Customer provides general written authorization to Granola to engage subprocessors as necessary to perform the Services.

* 4.2 A list of Granola‚Äôs current Authorized Subprocessors can be found at [trust.granola.ai/subprocessors](https://trust.granola.ai/subprocessors) (the ‚ÄúList‚Äù). Such List may be updated by Granola from time to time. Granola may provide a mechanism to subscribe to notifications of new Authorized Subprocessors and Customer agrees to subscribe to such notifications where available. At least ten (10) days before enabling any third party other than existing Authorized Subprocessors to access or participate in the processing of Personal Data, Granola will add such third party to the List and notify Customer via email. Customer may object to such an engagement by informing Granola within ten (10) days of receipt of the aforementioned notice to Customer, provided such objection is in writing and based on reasonable grounds relating to data protection. Customer acknowledges that certain subprocessors are essential to providing the Services and that objecting to the use of a subprocessor may prevent Granola from offering the Services to Customer.

* 4.3 If Customer reasonably objects to an engagement in accordance with Section 4.2, and Granola cannot provide a commercially reasonable alternative within a reasonable period of time, Customer may discontinue the use of the affected Service by providing written notice to Granola. Discontinuation shall not relieve Customer of any fees owed to Granola under the Agreement.

* 4.4 If Customer does not object to the engagement of a third party in accordance with Section 4.2 within ten (10) days of notice by Granola, that third party will be deemed an Authorized Subprocessor for the purposes of this DPA.

* 4.5 Granola will enter into a written agreement with the Authorized Subprocessor imposing on the Authorized Subprocessor data protection obligations comparable to those imposed on Granola under this DPA with respect to the protection of Personal Data. In case an Authorized Subprocessor fails to fulfill its data protection obligations under such written agreement with Granola, Granola will remain liable to Customer for the performance of the Authorized Subprocessor‚Äôs obligations under such agreement.

* 4.6 If Customer and Granola have entered into Standard Contractual Clauses as described in Section 6 (Transfers of Personal Data), (i) the above authorizations will constitute Customer‚Äôs prior written consent to the subcontracting by Granola of the processing of Personal Data if such consent is required under the Standard Contractual Clauses, and (ii) the parties agree that the copies of the agreements with Authorized Subprocessors that must be provided by Granola to Customer pursuant to Clause 9(c) of the EU SCCs may have commercial information, or information unrelated to the Standard Contractual Clauses or their equivalent, removed by Granola beforehand, and that such copies will be provided by Granola only upon request by Customer.

# 5. Security of Personal Data.

Taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, Granola shall maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing Personal Data, as described on Granola‚Äôs Trust Center, available at: [trust.granola.ai](https://trust.granola.ai) (‚ÄúGranola Security Page‚Äù).

# 6. Transfers of Personal Data

* 6.1 The parties agree that Granola may transfer Personal Data processed under this DPA outside the EEA, the UK, or Switzerland as necessary to provide the Services. Customer acknowledges that Granola‚Äôs primary processing operations take place in the United States, and that the transfer of Customer‚Äôs Personal Data to the United States is necessary for the provision of the Services to Customer. If Granola transfers Personal Data protected under this DPA to a jurisdiction for which the European Commission has not issued an adequacy decision, Granola will ensure that appropriate safeguards have been implemented for the transfer of Personal Data in accordance with Data Protection Laws.

* 6.2 Ex-EEA Transfers. The parties agree that ex-EEA Transfers will be made (i) pursuant to the Data Privacy Framework, or (ii) if the Data Privacy Framework does not apply or ceases to be available, pursuant to the EU SCCs, which are deemed entered into (and incorporated into this DPA by this reference) and completed as follows:

  * 6.2.1 Module One (Controller to Controller) of the EU SCCs apply when Granola is processing Personal Data as a controller pursuant to Section 9 of this DPA.

  * 6.2.2 Module Two (Controller to Processor) of the EU SCCs apply when Customer is a controller and Granola is processing Personal Data for Customer as a processor pursuant to Section 2 of this DPA.

  * 6.2.3 Module Three (Processor to Subprocessor) of the EU SCCs apply when Customer is a processor and Granola is processing Personal Data on behalf of Customer as a subprocessor.

* 6.3 For each module, where applicable the following applies:

  * 6.3.1 The optional docking clause in Clause 7 does not apply.

  * 6.3.2 In Clause 9, Option 2 (general written authorization) applies, and the minimum time period for prior notice of subprocessor changes shall be as set forth in Section 4.2 of this DPA;

  * 6.3.3 In Clause 11, the optional language does not apply;

  * 6.3.4 All square brackets in Clause 13 are hereby removed;

  * 6.3.5 In Clause 17 (Option 1), the EU SCCs will be governed by the law of the Republic of Ireland;

  * 6.3.6 In Clause 18(b), disputes will be resolved before the courts of the Republic of Ireland;

  * 6.3.7 Exhibit B to this DPA contains the information required in Annex I and Annex III of the EU SCCs;

  * 6.3.8 The Granola Security Page contains the information required in Annex II of the EU SCCs; and

  * 6.3.9 By entering into this DPA, the parties are deemed to have signed the EU SCCs incorporated herein, including their Annexes.

* 6.4. Ex-UK Transfers. The parties agree that ex-UK Transfers will be made (i) pursuant to the Data Privacy Framework, or (ii) if the Data Privacy Framework does not apply or ceases to be available, pursuant to the UK SCCs, which are deemed entered into and incorporated into this DPA by reference, and amended and completed in accordance with the UK Addendum, which is incorporated herein as Exhibit C of this DPA.

* 6.5 Transfers from Switzerland. The parties agree that transfers from Switzerland will be made (i) pursuant to the Data Privacy Framework, or (ii) if the Data Privacy Framework does not apply or ceases to be available, pursuant to the EU SCCs with the following modifications:

  * 6.5.1 The terms ‚ÄúGeneral Data Protection Regulation‚Äù or ‚ÄúRegulation (EU) 2016/679‚Äù as utilized in the EU SCCs shall be interpreted to include the Federal Act on Data Protection of 19 June 1992 (the ‚ÄúFADP,‚Äù and as revised as of 25 September 2020, the ‚ÄúRevised FADP‚Äù) with respect to data transfers subject to the FADP.

  * 6.5.1 The terms of the EU SCCs shall be interpreted to protect the data of legal entities until the effective date of the Revised FADP.

  * 6.5.2. Clause 13 of the EU SCCs is modified to provide that the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (‚ÄúFDPIC‚Äù) of Switzerland shall have authority over data transfers governed by the FADP and the appropriate EU supervisory authority shall have authority over data transfers governed by the GDPR. Subject to the foregoing, all other requirements of Clause 13 shall be observed.

  * 6.5.3. The term ‚ÄúEU Member State‚Äù as utilized in the EU SCCs shall not be interpreted in such a way as to exclude Data Subjects in Switzerland from exercising their rights in their place of habitual residence in accordance with Clause 18(c) of the EU SCCs.

* 6.6 Supplementary Measures. In respect of any ex-EEA Transfer or ex-UK Transfer made pursuant to the Standard Contractual Clauses, the following supplementary measures shall apply:

  * 6.6.1 As of the date of this DPA, the Data Importer has not received any formal legal requests from any government intelligence or security service/agencies in the country to which the Personal Data is being exported, for access to (or for copies of) Customer‚Äôs Personal Data (‚ÄúGovernment Agency Requests‚Äù).

  * 6.6.2 If, after the date of this DPA, the Data Importer receives any Government Agency Requests, Granola shall attempt to redirect the law enforcement or government agency to request that data directly from Customer. As part of this effort, Granola may provide Customer‚Äôs basic contact information to the government agency. If compelled to disclose Customer‚Äôs Personal Data to a law enforcement or government agency, Granola shall give Customer reasonable notice of the demand and cooperate to allow Customer to seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy unless Granola is legally prohibited from doing so. Granola shall not voluntarily disclose Personal Data to any law enforcement or government agency. Data Exporter and Data Importer shall (as soon as reasonably practicable) discuss and determine whether all or any transfers of Personal Data pursuant to this DPA should be suspended in the light of the such Government Agency Requests;

  * 6.6.3 The Data Exporter and Data Importer will meet regularly to consider whether:

    * i) the protection afforded by the laws of the country of the Data Importer to data subjects whose Personal Data is being transferred is sufficient to provide broadly equivalent protection to that afforded in the EEA or the UK, whichever the case may be;

    * ii) additional measures are reasonably necessary to enable the transfer to be compliant with the Data Protection Laws; and

    * iii) it is still appropriate for Personal Data to be transferred to the relevant Data Importer, taking into account all relevant information available to the parties, together with guidance provided by the supervisory authorities.

  * 6.6.4. If Data Protection Laws require the Data Exporter to execute the Standard Contractual Clauses applicable to a particular transfer of Personal Data to a Data Importer as a separate agreement, the Data Importer shall, on request of the Data Exporter, promptly execute such Standard Contractual Clauses incorporating such amendments as may reasonably be required by the Data Exporter to reflect the applicable appendices and annexes, the details of the transfer and the requirements of the relevant Data Protection Laws.

  * 6.6.5. If either (i) any of the means of legitimizing transfers of Personal Data outside of the EEA or UK set forth in this DPA cease to be valid or (ii) any supervisory authority requires transfers of Personal Data pursuant to those means to be suspended, then Data Importer may by notice to the Data Exporter, with effect from the date set out in such notice, amend or put in place alternative arrangements in respect of such transfers, as required by Data Protection Laws.

# 7. Rights of Data Subjects

* 7.1 Granola shall, to the extent permitted by law, notify Customer upon receipt of a request by a Data Subject to exercise the Data Subject‚Äôs right of: access, rectification, erasure, data portability, restriction or cessation of processing, withdrawal of consent to processing, and/or objection to being subject to processing that constitutes automated decision-making (such requests individually and collectively ‚ÄúData Subject Request(s)‚Äù). If Granola receives a Data Subject Request in relation to Customer‚Äôs data, Granola will advise the Data Subject to submit their request to Customer and Customer will be responsible for responding to such request, including, where necessary, by using the functionality of the Services. Customer is solely responsible for ensuring that Data Subject Requests for erasure, restriction or cessation of processing, or withdrawal of consent to processing of any Personal Data are communicated to Granola, and, if applicable, for ensuring that a record of consent to processing is maintained with respect to each Data Subject.

* 7.2 Granola shall, at the request of Customer, and taking into account the nature of the processing applicable to any Data Subject Request, apply appropriate technical and organizational measures to assist Customer in complying with Customer‚Äôs obligation to respond to such Data Subject Request and/or in demonstrating such compliance, where possible, *provided that* (i) Customer is itself unable to respond without Granola‚Äôs assistance and (ii) Granola is able to do so in accordance with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations.

1. Although Clause 5 of the Approved EU SCCs sets out that the Approved EU SCCs prevail over all related agreements between the parties, the parties agree that, for ex-UK Transfers, the hierarchy in Section 10 below will prevail.

2. Where there is any inconsistency or conflict between the Approved UK Addendum and the EU SCCs (as applicable), the Approved UK Addendum overrides the EU SCCs, except where (and in so far as) the inconsistent or conflicting terms of the EU SCCs provides greater protection for data subjects, in which case those terms will override the Approved UK Addendum.

3. Where this UK Addendum incorporates EU SCCs which have been entered into to protect ex-EU Transfers subject to the GDPR, then the parties acknowledge that nothing in the UK Addendum impacts those EU SCCs.

### Incorporation and Changes to the\*\* \*\*EU SCCs:

1. This UK Addendum incorporates the EU SCCs which are amended to the extent necessary so that:

   1. together they operate for data transfers made by the data exporter to the data importer, to the extent that UK Data Protection Laws apply to the data exporter‚Äôs processing when making that data transfer, and they provide Appropriate Safeguards for those data transfers;

   2. Sections 9 to 11 above override Clause 5 (Hierarchy) of the EU SCCs; and

   3. the UK Addendum (including the EU SCCs incorporated into it) is (1) governed by the laws of England and Wales and (2) any dispute arising from it is resolved by the courts of England and Wales.

2. Unless the parties have agreed alternative amendments which meet the requirements of Section 12 of this UK Addendum, the provisions of Section 15 of this UK Addendum will apply.

3. No amendments to the Approved EU SCCs other than to meet the requirements of Section 12 of this UK Addendum may be made.

- 4.7. Third Party Integrations. Customer acknowledges and agrees that (i) the Services may operate on, with or using Third Party Integrations, (ii) the availability and operation of the Services or certain portions thereof may be dependent on Granola‚Äôs ability to access such Third Party Integrations, and (iii) where applicable, Customer‚Äôs failure to provide adequate access or any retraction of permissions relating to such Third Party Integrations may result in a suspension or interruption of the Services. Customer hereby represents and warrants that it has all rights, licenses, permissions and consents necessary to connect, use and access any Third Party Integrations that it integrates with the Services, and Customer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Granola for all claims, damages and liabilities arising out of Customer‚Äôs use of any such Third Party Integrations in connection with or through the Services. Granola cannot and does not guarantee that the Services shall incorporate (or continue to incorporate) any particular Third Party Integrations and does not make any representations or warranties with respect to Third Party Integrations. Customer may be responsible for procuring any necessary rights for it to access Third Party Integrations (including any Customer Data or other information relating thereto) and for complying with any applicable terms or conditions thereof, in which case any exchange of data or other interaction between Customer and a third-party provider is solely between Customer and such third party provider is governed by such third party‚Äôs terms and conditions. By authorizing Granola to transmit Customer Data from such Third Party Integrations into the Services, Customer represents and warrants to Granola that it has all right, power, and authority to provide such authorization. In the event that Customer accesses the Services through Granola‚Äôs iOS applications available via the Apple, Inc.

Customer acknowledges that AI Outputs may contain errors and misstatements and may be incomplete or inaccurate. Before leveraging any AI Outputs, Customer or any Authorized User is responsible for making its own determination that the AI Outputs are suitable, and Customer is solely responsible for any reliance on the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of any AI Outputs. Customer agrees that Granola will not be liable for any loss or damages arising from or related to Third Party Models or AI Outputs and shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless Granola with respect to any claims, damages or liability related thereto.

Certain aspects of the Services, such as the Client-Side Software, may contain or be distributed with open source software code or libraries (‚Äú**Open Source Components**‚Äù). Granola will provide a list of Open Source Components for a particular version of any distributed portion of the Services, such as the Client-Side Software, on Customer‚Äôs request.

For purposes of clarity, Open Source Components are Third Party Integrations as defined in this Agreement.

## 5. Payment.

Except as otherwise specified herein or in an Order Form, (a) fees are based on Services subscriptions purchased and not actual usage, (b) payment obligations are non-cancelable and fees paid are non-refundable, and (c) quantities purchased cannot be decreased during the relevant Subscription Period.

- 5.2. Invoicing and Payment. If Customer pays online via credit or debit card, Customer agrees to be bound by the Stripe, Inc. Services Agreement available at [https://stripe.com/us/legal.](https://stripe.com/us/legal.) Customer will provide Granola with valid and updated credit card information, or with a valid purchase order or alternative document reasonably acceptable to Granola. If Customer provides credit card information to Granola, Customer authorizes Granola to charge such credit card for all Services listed in the Order Form for the initial subscription term and any renewal subscription term(s) as set forth in the ‚ÄúTerm of Subscriptions‚Äù section below. Such charges shall be made in advance, either annually or in accordance with any different billing frequency stated in the applicable Order Form. If the Order Form specifies that payment will be by a method other than a credit card, Granola will invoice Customer in advance and otherwise in accordance with the relevant Order Form. Unless otherwise stated in the Order Form, invoiced fees are due net thirty (30) days from the invoice date. Customer is responsible for providing complete and accurate billing and contact information to Granola and notifying Granola of any changes to such information.

- 5.3. Overdue Charges. If any invoiced amount is not received by Granola by the due date, then without limiting Granola‚Äôs rights or remedies, (a) those charges may accrue late interest at the rate of 1.5% of the outstanding balance per month, or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is lower, and/or (b) Granola may condition future subscription renewals and Order Forms on payment terms shorter than those specified in the ‚ÄúInvoicing and Payment‚Äù section above.

- 5.4. Suspension of Services and Acceleration. If any charge owing by Customer under this or any other agreement for Services is thirty (30) days or more overdue, (or ten (10) or more days overdue in the case of amounts Customer has authorized Granola to charge to Customer‚Äôs credit card), Granola may, without limiting its other rights and remedies, accelerate Customer‚Äôs unpaid fee obligations under such agreements so that all such obligations become immediately due and payable, and suspend Services until such amounts are paid in full, provided that, other than for customers paying by credit card or direct debit whose payment has been declined, Granola will give Customer at least ten (10) days‚Äô prior notice that its account is overdue, in accordance with the ‚ÄúNotices‚Äù section below for billing notices, before suspending services to Customer.

- 5.5. Overages. If Customer exceeds any Authorized User or usage limitations set forth on an Order Form, then (i) Granola shall invoice Customer for such additional users or usage at the overage rates set forth on the Order Form (or if no overage rates are set forth on the Order Form, at Granola‚Äôs then-current standard overage rates for such usage), in each case on a pro-rata basis from the first date of such excess usage through the end of the applicable Subscription Period, and (ii) if the Subscription Period renews (in accordance with Section 8 below), such new Subscription Period shall include the additional fees for such excess Authorized Users and usage.

- 5.6. Payment Disputes. Granola will not exercise its rights under the ‚ÄúOverdue Charges‚Äù or ‚ÄúSuspension of Service and Acceleration‚Äù section above if Customer is disputing the applicable charges reasonably and in good faith and is cooperating diligently to resolve the dispute.

- 5.7. Taxes. Granola‚Äôs fees do not include any taxes, levies, duties or similar governmental assessments of any nature, including, for example, value-added, sales, use or withholding taxes, assessable by any jurisdiction whatsoever (collectively, ‚Äú**Taxes**‚Äù). Customer is responsible for paying all Taxes associated with its purchases hereunder. If Granola has the legal obligation to pay or collect Taxes for which Customer is responsible under this section, Granola will invoice Customer and Customer will pay that amount unless Customer provides Granola with a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority. For clarity, Granola is solely responsible for taxes assessable against it based on its income, property and employees.

## 6. Confidential Information.

- 6.1. Confidential Information. From time to time during the Subscription Period, either party may disclose or make available to the other party information about its business affairs, products, confidential intellectual property, trade secrets, third-party confidential information, and other sensitive or proprietary information, whether orally or in written, electronic, or other form or media that: (i) is marked, designated or otherwise identified as ‚Äúconfidential‚Äù or something similar at the time of disclosure or within a reasonable period of time thereafter; or (ii) would be considered confidential by a reasonable person given the nature of the information or the circumstances of its disclosure (collectively, ‚Äú**Confidential Information**‚Äù).

The receiving party shall not use the disclosing party‚Äôs Confidential Information except to perform its obligations and exercise its rights hereunder nor shall it disclose the disclosing party‚Äôs Confidential Information to any person or entity, except to the receiving party‚Äôs employees, contractors, and agents who have a need to know the Confidential Information for the receiving party to exercise its rights or perform its obligations hereunder (‚Äú**Representatives**‚Äù). The receiving party will be responsible for all the acts and omissions of its Representatives as they relate to Confidential Information hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party may disclose Confidential Information to the limited extent required (A) in order to comply with the order of a court or other governmental body, or as otherwise necessary to comply with applicable law, provided that the party making the disclosure pursuant to the order shall first have given written notice to the other party and made a reasonable effort to obtain a protective order; or (B) to establish a party‚Äôs rights under this Agreement, including to make required court filings.

- 6.3. Effect of Termination or Expiration. Upon expiration or termination of the Agreement, the receiving party shall promptly return to the disclosing party all copies, whether in written, electronic, or other form or media, of the disclosing party‚Äôs Confidential Information, or destroy all such copies and certify in writing to the disclosing party that such Confidential Information has been destroyed. Each party‚Äôs obligations of non-use and non-disclosure with regard to Confidential Information are effective as of the Effective Date and will expire three (3) years from the date of termination or expiration of this Agreement; provided, however, with respect to any Confidential Information that constitutes a trade secret (as determined under applicable law), such obligations of non-disclosure will survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement until such Confidential Information is no longer considered a trade secret under applicable law through no wrongful act or omission of the receiving party.

## 7. Data Security; Processing of Personal Information.

- 7.1. Security Measures. Granola shall use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the security and integrity of the Services and the Customer Data.

- 7.2. Processing of Personal Data. Granola‚Äôs rights and obligations with respect to Personal Data that it collects directly from individuals are set forth in Granola‚Äôs [Privacy Policy](https://go.granola.so/privacy).

- 12.14. Injunctive Relief. Notwithstanding the foregoing obligation to arbitrate disputes, each party shall have the right to pursue injunctive or other equitable relief at any time, from any court of competent jurisdiction, to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights.

- 12.15. Exclusive Venue. In the event the arbitration agreement does not apply, and the parties agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions) will be brought in the state or federal courts located in, respectively, New York, New York, or the federal district in which that county falls.

Customer has separately agreed to our [Platform Terms](https://go.granola.so/platform-tos) or entered into a written agreement with us or our affiliate(s) (in either case, the ‚Äú**Agreement**‚Äù) that permits Customer to create and configure a Team so that you and others could join (each invitee granted access to the Services, including you, is an ‚Äú**Authorized User**‚Äù). The Agreement contains our commitment to deliver the Services to Customer, who may then invite Authorized Users to join the Team. When an Authorized User (including, you) submits content or information to the Services (‚Äú**Customer Data**‚Äù), you acknowledge and agree that the Customer Data is owned by Customer and the Agreement provides Customer with many choices and control over that Customer Data. For example, Customer may provision or deprovision access to the Services, enable or disable third party integrations, manage permissions, retention and export settings, transfer, assign or consolidate Teams, and these choices and instructions may result in the access, use, disclosure, modification or deletion of certain or all Customer Data. These User Terms remain effective until Customer‚Äôs subscription for you expires or terminates, or your access to the Services has been terminated by Customer or us. Please contact Customer if you at any time or for any reason wish to terminate your account.

AS BETWEEN US AND CUSTOMER, YOU AGREE THAT IT IS SOLELY CUSTOMER‚ÄôS RESPONSIBILITY TO (A) INFORM YOU AND ANY AUTHORIZED USERS OF ANY RELEVANT CUSTOMER POLICIES AND PRACTICES AND ANY SETTINGS THAT MAY IMPACT THE PROCESSING OF CUSTOMER DATA; (B) OBTAIN ANY RIGHTS, PERMISSIONS OR CONSENTS FROM YOU AND ANY AUTHORIZED USERS THAT ARE NECESSARY FOR THE LAWFUL USE OF CUSTOMER DATA AND THE OPERATION OF THE SERVICES INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, AS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE RECORDING LAWS (DEFINED BELOW); (C) ENSURE THAT THE TRANSFER AND PROCESSING OF CUSTOMER DATA UNDER THE AGREEMENT IS LAWFUL; AND (D) RESPOND TO AND RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE WITH YOU AND ANY AUTHORIZED USER RELATING TO OR BASED ON CUSTOMER DATA, THE SERVICES OR CUSTOMER‚ÄôS FAILURE TO FULFILL THESE OBLIGATIONS. GRANOLA MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, TO YOU RELATING TO THE SERVICES, WHICH ARE PROVIDED TO YOU ON AN ‚ÄúAS IS‚Äù AND ‚ÄúAS AVAILABLE‚Äù BASIS.

To the extent prohibited by applicable law, the Services are not intended for and should not be used by¬†(a) anyone under the age of sixteen or (b) anyone under the applicable age of majority according to the data protection laws and regulations in your jurisdiction.¬†You represent that you are over the legal age and are the intended recipient of Customer‚Äôs invitation to the Services. You may not access or use the Services for any purpose if either of the representations in the preceding sentence is not true.

You represent, warrant, and agree that you will not provide or contribute anything, including any Customer Data, to the Services, or otherwise use or interact with the Services, in a manner that: (a) violates any law or regulation, including, without limitation, any applicable export control laws, privacy laws, laws governing the monitoring or recording of conversations (‚Äú**Recording Laws**‚Äù) or any other purpose not reasonably intended by Granola; (b) is dangerous, fraudulent, harassing, defamatory, or obscene; (c) jeopardizes the security of your account or anyone else‚Äôs (such as allowing someone else to log in to the Services as you); (d) attempts, in any manner, to obtain the password, account, or other security information from any other user; (e) violates the security of any computer network, or cracks any passwords or security encryption codes; (f) runs Maillist, Listserv, any form of auto-responder or ‚Äúspam‚Äù on the Services, or any processes that run or are activated while you are not logged into the Services, or that otherwise interfere with the proper working of the Services (including by placing an unreasonable load on the Services‚Äô infrastructure); (g) ‚Äúcrawls,‚Äù ‚Äúscrapes,‚Äù or ‚Äúspiders‚Äù any page, data, or portion of or relating to the Services or content made available through the Services (through use of manual or automated means); (h) copies or stores any significant portion of the content made available through the Services; or (i) decompiles, reverse engineers, or otherwise attempts to obtain the source code or underlying ideas or information of or relating to the Services. A violation of any of the foregoing is grounds for termination of your right to use or access the Services.

If we believe that there is a violation of the Agreement, User Terms or any of our other policies that can simply be remedied by Customer‚Äôs removal of certain Customer Data or taking other action, we will, in most cases, ask Customer to take action rather than intervene. We may directly step in and take what we determine to be appropriate action (including disabling your account) if Customer does not take appropriate action or we believe there is a credible risk of harm to us, the Services, Authorized Users, or any third parties. IN NO EVENT WILL YOU OR WE HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO THE OTHER FOR ANY LOST PROFITS OR REVENUES OR FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, COVER OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES HOWEVER CAUSED, WHETHER IN AGREEMENT, TORT OR UNDER ANY OTHER THEORY OF LIABILITY, AND WHETHER OR NOT THE PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. UNLESS YOU ARE ALSO A CUSTOMER (AND WITHOUT LIMITATION TO OUR RIGHTS AND REMEDIES UNDER THE AGREEMENT), YOU WILL HAVE NO FINANCIAL LIABILITY TO US FOR A BREACH OF THESE USER TERMS. OUR MAXIMUM AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY BREACH OF THE USER TERMS IS ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100) IN THE AGGREGATE. THE FOREGOING DISCLAIMERS WILL NOT APPLY TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW AND DO NOT LIMIT EITHER PARTY‚ÄôS RIGHT TO SEEK AND OBTAIN EQUITABLE RELIEF.

Except as otherwise set forth herein, all notices under the User Terms will be by email, although we may instead choose to provide notice to Authorized Users through the Services. Notices to Granola should be sent [hello@granola.so](mailto:hello@granola.so). A notice will be deemed to have been duly given (a) the day after it is sent, in the case of a notice sent through email; and (b) the same day, in the case of a notice sent through the Services. Notices under the Agreement will be delivered solely to Customer in accordance with the terms of that agreement. Please also feel free to contact us if you have any questions about Granola‚Äôs User Terms. You may contact us at¬†[hello@granola.so](mailto:hello@granola.so).

As our business evolves, we may change these User Terms. If we make a material change to the User Terms, we will provide you with reasonable notice prior to the change taking effect either by emailing the email address associated with your account or by messaging you through the Services. You can review the most current version of the User Terms at any time by visiting this page, and by visiting the following for the most current versions of our¬†[Privacy Policy](https://go.granola.so/privacy). Any material revisions to these User Terms will become effective on the date set forth in our notice, and all other changes will become effective on the date we publish the change. If you use the Services after the effective date of any changes, that use will constitute your acceptance of the revised terms and conditions. No failure or delay by either party in exercising any right under the User Terms will constitute a waiver of that right. No waiver under the User Terms will be effective unless made in writing and signed by an authorized representative of the party being deemed to have granted the waiver. The User Terms will be enforced to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law. If any provision of the User Terms is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law, the provision will be modified by the court and interpreted so as best to accomplish the objectives of the original provision to the fullest extent permitted by law, and the remaining provisions of the User Terms will remain in effect. You may not assign any of your rights or delegate your obligations under these User Terms whether by operation of law or otherwise, without the prior written consent of us (not to be unreasonably withheld). We may assign these User Terms in their entirety (including all terms and conditions incorporated herein by reference), without your consent, to a corporate affiliate or in connection with a merger, acquisition, corporate reorganization, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets.

The User Terms and any disputes arising out of or related hereto, will be governed exclusively by the same applicable governing law of the Agreement, without regard to conflicts of laws rules or the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods. The courts located in the applicable venue of the Agreement will have exclusive jurisdiction to adjudicate any dispute arising out of or relating to the User Terms or its formation, interpretation or enforcement. Each party hereby consents and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts. In any action or proceeding to enforce rights under the User Terms, the prevailing party will be entitled to recover its reasonable costs and attorney‚Äôs fees.

The User Terms, including any terms incorporated by reference into the User Terms, constitute the entire agreement between you and us and supersede all prior and contemporaneous agreements, proposals or representations, written or oral, concerning its subject matter. To the extent of any conflict or inconsistency between the provisions in these User Terms and any pages referenced in these User Terms, the terms of these User Terms will first prevail; provided, however, that if there is a conflict or inconsistency between the Agreement and the User Terms, the terms of the Agreement will first prevail, followed by the provisions in these User Terms, and then followed by the pages referenced in these User Terms (e.g., the [Privacy Policy](https://go.granola.so/privacy)). Customer will be responsible for notifying Authorized Users of those conflicts or inconsistencies and until such time the terms set forth herein will be binding.
